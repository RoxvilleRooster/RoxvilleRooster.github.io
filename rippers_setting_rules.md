# Adapting Rippers setting rules for Swade


## Outsider

Instead of the -2 Charisma penalty (SWDEE), the character takes a -1 penalty to Persuasion rolls and she cannot re-roll failed rolls.

## Reason
A character with Reason less than 4 suffers a –1 penalty to Persuasion but gains a +1 bonus to Intimidation. 
If Reason drops to 0, the Persuasion penalty increases to –2 and the Intimidation bonus becomes +2

## Fright table

State: Update to existing rules for fright state
Paralyzed: Add Vulnerable  
Unhinged: Add Distracted
Traumatized: Add Distracted
Breakdown: Add Distracted and Vulnerable
Snapped: Add Distracted and Vulnerable
