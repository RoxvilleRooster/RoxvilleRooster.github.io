Welcome to a dishonorable story of ill-fated treasure hunters whoâ€™ll soon bite off more than
they can chew... unless they manage to return home with enough gold to carouse wildly until their next expedition!
_Gold & Glory_ is not your usual Savage Worlds setting - it strives to emulate an OSR-like experience.
We'll use the "Wild Draw" character creation process and deal from the Dungeon Deck to generate dungeons on the fly.
Experience is earned using the "In for the Gold!" system, which is based on loot acquired and then spent.
Streamlined encumbrance rules give you enough flavor without the insane bookkeeping.
You can find Gold & Glory at http://ggstudio.eu/en/goldglory and on DTRPG at 
http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/223242/GoldGlory-Seven-Deadly-Dungeons?term=Gold+%26+Glory&test_epoch=0
This will be run largely like a pick-up game, at least in the early stages.

## Encumbrance
Items are considered Light, Normal or Heavy.
* _Light_ items are small objects (e.g., scrolls, vials, etc.) and weigh 0.
* Most items are _Normal_ and weigh 1 (e.g., all one-handed weapons).
* _Heavy_ items weigh 2 (e.g., two-handed weapons and other bulkier items). 
* Full plate armor is the only exception and weighs 4. 
At the GM's discretion, a group of Light Items carried by a
character can collectively weigh 1 (or more).
Coins: 500 coins count as 1 Normal item for Encumbrance. 

### Weight limit
Weight Limit is equal to your Strength die. Strength d8 means you can carry 8
Normal items without being encumbered. Apply this value to the standard Savage
Worlds Encumbrance rules.
*Note*: The *Brawny* edge increases your Vigor die as usual, and it increases your
Weight Limit and subsequent Encumbrance steps by +50%.
