# Daring Tales of Adventure: Two-Fisted Action in the Classic Age of Pulp
* Starting with "Rocket Nazis on the Orient Express", the aim is to play through many of the Daring Tales of Adventure series (Triple Ace Games)
* As a player, you are one of the good guys; make sure your character has a reason why she would get involved in globetrotting, heroic exploits
* There will be chases, death traps, exotic locations, zeppelins, and fights on top of trains
* You do not have to play the [Daring Tales of Adventure pregens](http://www.tripleacegames.com/free-downloads/daring-tales-of-adventure/), but the party needs to have at least one pilot and one gadget/science character
