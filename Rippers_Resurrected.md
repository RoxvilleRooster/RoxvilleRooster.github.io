## Fear

Given the lack of any updated Fright table (RR 31) from the SWADE conversion notes for Rippers Resurrected and the need for a customized table for the setting, I adapted this table for Rippers Resurrected for SWADE.  
For reference, the Fear Table is on SWADE 124.

Fright table

<div class="note">

A character with rippertech makes a Spirit roll at –2, with a bonus equal to their current Reason.
On a failure, the character gains ripping psychosis instead of rolling for Temporary Psychosis.
If the psychosis is Major and the hero began with a Reason of 0 (before any loss due to the Table result), the character becomes an nonplayer character villain under the GM’s control on a failed roll.

## Expectations for the campaign

-   We want to follow the "Fast, Furious, and Fun" ethos

-   Learn the Roll20 technology for Savage Worlds but you do not need to know Roll20 when you first join

-   Learn the Savage Worlds rules; if you’re new to Savage Worlds rules, you can download the most recent [Savage Worlds Test Drive](https://www.peginc.com/store/savage-worlds-test-drive-lankhmar/)

-   If you have any rules for your character’s schticks (e.g., arcane powers or gambling), learn them or have the rules handy

-   You’ll get bennies for trying to do cool things, making the game fun and interesting, playing according to the tone, and playing hindrances

-   Bring your imagination and a willingness to narrate and add to the story [1]

-   Be engaged during the game session and do your best to pay attention

-   Share the stage so your fellow players can shine

-   If you cannot attend the game at the specified time, give reasonable advanced notice

-   Give the GM feedback on what is working well, what you want to see more of, and what could use some work

-   Engage in an adult conversation if we ever need to course correct

-   Stay classy; read and heed the tabletop creed
