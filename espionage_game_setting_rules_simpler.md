And there's a [playlist](https://play.spotify.com/user/achall-us/playlist/1NIH7MURguqFqBgcLJxhlj).

It's go time!


## Operative training

*The following rule supplements the Savage Worlds character creation rules.*

Agency candidates do not wash out. Six weeks of training gives you the following
skills at a d4: Fighting, Notice, Shooting, and Tradecraft.
You also begin with the Hindrance: Obligations (Major: Agency). This does
NOT count towards your normal Hindrance total.

## Languages
Besides their native tongue, all agents know half their Smarts die in languages.
They speak with an obvious accent, betraying their nationality. Social interaction
skills dependent upon speech are at a -2 when attempted in the speaker’s nonnative
tongue.

## New skills

### Demolitions (Smarts)
The ability to identify, set, shape, and defuse explosives. Explosions may be planted
in a focused and discrete manner, or “shaped” to cover a greater area.
Amount of Explosive Maximum Size of Effect
2d6 SBT
3d6 SBT
4d6 MBT, Cone
5d6 LBT, Cone

### Forgery (Smarts)
The ability to fabricate, adapt or imitate objects or documents with the intent to
deceive. Attempting to make forgeries without the proper tools is done at –2. The
tools vary wildly, depending upon the nature of the item in question.

### Tech Ops (Smarts)
Technical Operations is the ability to operate, secure, and sabotage computer and
electronic systems.

### Tradecraft (Smarts)
This skill reflects the practical application of procedures and protocols such as dead
drops, brief encounters, pickups, load and unload signals, danger and safe signals,
and the fine arts of surveillance and counter-surveillance. It also covers knowledge
of other world agencies as well as aiding in field requisitions and governs exactly
what you can requisition at any given Rank.

## New hindrances

### Obligations (Minor or Major)
The agent is connected to someone or something demanding a portion of his
time. These obligations can include almost anything, such as checking in on a
sick relative from time to time or a tenured professor giving lectures and teaching
classes. Failure to fulfill such obligations eventually has serious repercussions. An
agent with Obligations and Connections to the same individual or organization
has a special relationship with the person or group in question, and gains a +2
bonus to Persuasion rolls (+4 if Major Obligations) when dealing with them. In
essence, the Connection has a vested interest in the agent, and is more likely to
want him to succeed.

In the case of Obligations to an agency, an agent who regularly fails to meet his
responsibilities to the organization, often ignoring rules to get the job done, may
be considered a loose cannon. This type of behavior can impact his assignments
and his ability to requisition key items, at the Director’s discretion. Continued
failure to uphold the agency’s principles may ultimately result in the agent being
declared rogue. In this case, Obligations dissipate and are replaced with the
Hindrance Wanted (Major) by the agency in question.

## New edges
*Combat Edges*


### Carnivore
**Requirements**: Novice, Strength d8+, Berserk, Fighting d8+

As a free action, the agent may make a Spirit roll to voluntarily go berserk. He may
also go berserk automatically by spending a benny.

### Deadly
**Requirements**: Heroic, Smarts d8+, Fighting or Throwing d10+

For this agent, everything is a weapon. Any object that would normally do
negligible damage (such as a paper clip or a thimble) does Str+d4. Additionally,
normally non-lethal items can be used to inflict deadly damage at the Director’s
discretion.

**Example**: Jake Britain (with a Str d6) is sitting at a table in a street cafe when a
Pandoran agent rushes toward him. Jake lunges with his plastic drinking straw,
smashing it into the Pandoran’s throat, causing d6+d4 damage! Leaving him
wheezing in the road, Jake quickly and quietly flees the scene.

### Disarm Mastery
**Requirements**: Novice, Fighting d8+, Martial Artist

The agent excels at removing an opponent’s weapon in melee combat. He makes
an opposed Fighting roll against his opponent. With a success, the adversary
drops his weapon. With a raise, the opponent is Shaken and the weapon flies 1d4
random inches away or the agent may elect to take it if he has one or both hands
free.

### Fast Strike
**Requirements**: Seasoned, Agility d8+, Fighting d8+

The agent has learned to fight with great dexterity — moving in and striking
quickly, then moving away before his opponent can react. If the character can
move at least 2” before making an attack, he may strike and withdraw from
combat without the target, or any other opponents, receiving a free attack. The
agent is still subject to First Strike attacks from adjacent foes as normal.

### Ghost
**Requirements**: Novice, Agility d8+, Smarts d8+

This agent is trained to use subterfuge in hostile situations. He receives +2 to all
Tricks.

### Grab and Hold
**Requirements**: Novice, Martial Artist

The agent’s intimate knowledge of wrestling maneuvers grants him a +1 to any
opposed Strength or Agility grappling rolls. Additionally, he substitutes his
unarmed (martial artist) damage for normal grappling damage.

**Normal**: Snake has Martial Artist and does Str+d4 damage with his
unarmed strikes. When he grapples, he does only his Strength in damage.

**Example**: Snake learns Grab and Hold. Now, he may apply his unarmed combat
(martial artist) damage to grappled opponents, doing Str+d4 damage to anyone within
his iron grasp. Should he later get Improved Martial Artist, it increases to
Str+d6.

### Grizzled
**Requirements**: Seasoned, Spirit d6+, Vigor d8+

The agent’s field work has made him tough — even his scars have scars. He gains
+2 to Soak rolls.

### Gun Fu
**Requirements**: Seasoned, Martial Artist, Shooting d8+

The agent is able to maneuver well enough to continue using any firearm in close
combat.

**Normal**: Agent Rook has an M-16 and is rushed by a werewolf. He can club the
beast with it, but is unable to get a bead on the creature as it bites and slashes at
him.

**Example**: Agent Rook, having survived his close encounter, learns Gun Fu and
takes point. The next lycanthrope to jump down on him from the shadows is in
for a nasty surprise, as he unloads his clip into the creature at point blank range.

### Hindsight
**Requirements**: Novice, Fighting d10+

Through luck, skill, or a combination of both, this agent is able to expertly defend
himself against multiple foes. Opponents gain no gang up bonus against him.

### Ranged Pin
**Requirements**: Seasoned, Shooting d8+ or Throwing d8+

The agent may use certain missile weapons (knives, arrows, spears, etc.) to pin
opponents to nearby surfaces. The opponent must be within 1”of a wall, tree, or
similar surface. Make a Shooting or Throwing roll at –2. If successful, the target
takes normal damage and is pinned, requiring a successful Strength roll to break
free. With a raise, the opponent must make his Strength roll at –2 or remain
pinned.

### Silent Kill
**Requirements**: Veteran, Improved Martial Artist

This agent has been trained in the art of stealth assassination. Whenever he
successfully kills an enemy unnoticed in a single round, he may attempt one of
two actions: He may pin the body in place with a Smarts roll or make a Stealth
roll to catch the body and quietly move and/or hide it with the remainder of his
movement. Either choice is a free action.

**Example**: Agent Suzuki, creeping along the rooftop of a mafia safe house, drops
down upon a sentry and kills him in one blow. He may then make a Stealth roll to
catch the body and move it under the bushes before being spotted. With a success,
the other guard at the end of the garden path may never suspect a thing.

### Superior Defense
**Requirements**: Veteran, Agility d8+, Block

The agent has mastered special defensive techniques. When using the Defend
maneuver, his Parry is increased by +4 (instead of +2). If using the Full Defense
maneuver, add +2 to his Fighting roll to determine the Parry score.

### Takedown
**Requirements**: Novice, Fighting d8+

The agent is trained in how to throw or trip an opponent. Make an opposed
Fighting roll versus the target. Each Size category difference incurs a –2 penalty.
With a success, the now prone opponent may be placed in any spot within 1”of
the agent. With a raise, the opponent is prone and Shaken; if already Shaken, he
takes a wound.

### Typewriter
**Requirements**: Novice, Agility d8+, Fighting d8+

The agent knows how to strike foes with maximum effect. He receives +2 to
unarmed damage rolls.


### Wheelman
**Requirements**: Seasoned, Ace

This agent is a demon behind the wheel, able to fire any one-handed weapon while
driving without suffering a multi-action penalty. When using the Chase rules,
he receives an additional Action card with a success or better on his Driving roll
when he’s the driver.

*Profesional Edges*

### Cleaner
**Requirements**: Seasoned, Investigator

You know how to hide information as well as uncover it. You may make the
appropriate roll to hide or obliterate evidence. Others coming behind you must
make an opposed roll to uncover any trace of your presence. The agent receives
an additional +1 to Investigation, Streetwise, and Notice rolls when searching
through or obfuscating information. This stacks with the Investigator Edge.

### Demolisher
**Requirements**: Novice, Smarts d8+, Demolitions d8+

The agent receives +2 on demolitions rolls when placing charges, and damage with
explosives may Ace.

### Engineer
**Requirements**: Novice, Smarts d6+, Repair d8+

The agent adds +2 to Repair rolls. With a raise, he halves the time normally required
to fix something. This means if a particular Repair job can be accomplished in half
the time with a raise, an engineer could finish the job in one-fourth the time.

### Forger
**Requirements**: Novice, Smarts d8+, Forgery d8+, Notice d6+

The agent makes excellent forgeries. He receives +2 to all Forgery rolls and +2 to
Notice rolls to detect fakes (Forgery vs. Notice).

### Master Forger
**Requirements**: Seasoned, Forger

The agent makes flawless forgeries, receiving +1 to all Forgery rolls and +1 to
Notice rolls to detect fakes. This stacks with the Forger Edge

### Hacker
**Requirements**: Novice, Smarts d8+, Tech Ops d10+

The agent is a master of penetrating electronic and computer security systems. He
receives +2 to all Tech Ops rolls and any Investigation rolls where he has access to a
computer. Each attempt to penetrate a system’s defenses takes 10 minutes instead
of the normal hour.

### Linguist
**Requirements**: Novice, Smarts d8+

The agent gains an additional number of languages equal to half his Smarts die.
Additionally, he may make a Smarts roll to identify, speak, and read unknown
languages as the situation warrants. As his Smarts die increases, he gains two
languages (the normal benefit of Smarts combined with this Edge).

### Maven
**Requirements**: Novice, Knowledge (Battle) d8+

At the beginning of each hostile encounter, the maven may make a Knowledge
(Battle) roll. For each success and raise, he receives a benny that may be used for
any agents on his team. Bennies not used by the end of scene are discarded. Note:
If more than one maven is on a team, the test is treated as a cooperative roll as
detailed in the Savage Worlds core rulebook.

### Spectre
**Requirements**: Seasoned, Agility d10+, Thief

A master of infiltration, Spectre unit members gain +1 to Climbing, Lockpicking
and Stealth rolls. These benefits stack with those gained from the Thief Edge.

### Sponge
**Requirements**: Novice, Jack-of-all-Trades

The agent is an amazing source of wide and varied information that can be dredged
up at a moment’s notice. He may spend a benny to have any Smarts-based skill at
d6 for the remainder of the scene.

*Social Edges*

### Flash and Panache

bonus to reaction modifiers and related skill rolls (such as Persuasion) when
throwing money around.

### Smooth Talker

any penalties as a non-native speaker. Additionally, you may adopt regional accents

any skill at a d6 for the remainder of a scene.


### Empty the Clip

You can fire all the remaining bullets in your automatic weapon with a normal
Shooting roll by spending a benny. You must have at least half a clip remaining

template before you roll. Targets then must make an opposed Agility roll against
the Shooting roll or they suffer standard damage for the weapon type.


### Impeccable Timing
**Requirements**: Legendary, Agility d10+, Quick

The agent has amazing reaction speed. Should he be dealt less than a 10 for
initiative, his card is treated as a 10 of the same suit (ties are resolved via opposed
Agility rolls).

### Classic shaken
Remember the original, unforgiving shaken rules? We'll use them.

On an his action, a Shaken character msut attempt to recover from being Shaken by making a Spirit roll:

* Failure: Character remains shaken and can only perform free actions.
* Success: Character is no longer Shaken, but can only perform free actions that turn.
* Raise: Character is no longer Shaken and can act normally.

A player can spend a benny anytime to remove the Shaken status from a character.

combat, he receives his normal +2 bonus to Trait
and damage rolls. In addition, all player characters
receive a Benny!

### Benny for your deuce
If you get a deuce for combat initiative, you get a benny.
This assumes that you act on the deuce. If you have multiple 
inititaive cards and choose to act on the deuce instead of the 
higher cards, you get this benny.

### The "screw me!" benny
If you roll double ones on a trait test, you can elect to take the failure and not use a benny to reroll. 
If you take the failure, you narrate the consequences and draw a benny.
