_These setting rules are are largely a subset of the rules from Reality Blurs' "Agents of Oblivion"._

# Game setting rules

The year is 1983.
You are agents working together in a joint mission under the service of The Agency, (NATO nations).

All the mission details are available as handouts inside the Roll20 campaign.

See the [Roll20 campaign](https://app.roll20.net/campaigns/details/1673998/savage-top-secret-1983).

Pregens are created with 0 XP and they are in the Roll20 game.
You have 25 XP (5 advances to spend).


Some sample tokens are [in Google Drive here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0lb1qfRe-jtQ2dIY3FwQk1QMmc).

And there's a [playlist](https://play.spotify.com/user/achall-us/playlist/1NIH7MURguqFqBgcLJxhlj).

It's go time!


## Operative training

*The following rule supplements the Savage Worlds character creation rules.*

Agency candidates do not wash out. Six weeks of training gives you the following
skills at a d4: Fighting, Notice, Shooting, and Tradecraft.
You also begin with the Hindrance: Obligations (Major: Agency). This does
NOT count towards your normal Hindrance total.

## Languages
Besides their native tongue, all agents know half their Smarts die in languages.
They speak with an obvious accent, betraying their nationality. Social interaction
skills dependent upon speech are at a -2 when attempted in the speaker’s nonnative
tongue.

### Classic shaken
Remember the original, unforgiving shaken rules? We'll use them.

On his action, a Shaken character must attempt to recover from being Shaken by making a Spirit roll:

* Failure: Character remains shaken and can only perform free actions.
* Success: Character is no longer Shaken, but can only perform free actions that turn.
* Raise: Character is no longer Shaken and can act normally.

A player can spend a benny anytime to remove the Shaken status from a character.


### Joker’s Wild
When a player character draws a Joker during
combat, he receives his normal +2 bonus to Trait
and damage rolls. In addition, all player characters
receive a Benny!

### The "screw me" benny
If you roll double ones on a trait test, you can elect to take the failure and not use a benny to reroll. 
If you take the failure, you narrate the consequences and draw a benny. 

### Success with a cost
If you roll a 1 on your skill die but your wild die is successful, that is still considered a success, but there is a negative effect or compromise (e.g., your weapon becomes entangled in an enemy's armor). 
The player can describe what the negative effect looks like. This is derived from a Dungeon World mechanic.
I also attribute the idea of applying this type of effect to Savage Worlds to Eric Lamoureux.
