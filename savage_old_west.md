This is an attempt at reproduce a cinematic "old west" campaign using the _Savage Worlds Deluxe Edition_ (SWDEE) rules. 
The setting rules of _Deadlands Reloaded_ and the _Sixth Gun_ that focus on fantasy and horror elements are set aside.
Unless stated otherwise, we're using the rules set out in SWDEE but there is significant borrowing of the less fantasy-oriented rules from _Deadlands Reloaded_.
