[horizontal]
2:: A Giant Spider hangs above the door and will attack the first character to enter.
3:: 
This room has a pressure-plate isolation trap. 
As soon as the first PC (and second, at the GM's discretion) enters this room, a stone wall will descend from the ceiling isolating the front rank from the rest of the party. 
The door to the north wall swings open and the skeletons from an adjacent room attack. 
A dark flagstone in the hallway floor just outside the door to the next room is loose and conceals a reset lever that will raise the stone slab. 
Testing the floor with a pole prior to entering may set off the trap (and break the pole).
4::
The door to this room is trapped.

5::
This room smells of rot and offal.
