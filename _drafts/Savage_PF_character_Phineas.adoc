.Ancestry Special Abilities
****
GNOME MAGIC:: 
Gnomes can cast cantrips (see page 173) as if they knew each of the following powers: light, sound, telekinesis, and beast friend using their Smarts (or arcane skill if they have one). 
They have 1 Power Point for activating these cantrips, regained as usual (see page 171). 
Gnomes with an Arcane Background add their bonus Power Point to their pool but
must still learn the spells if they wish to cast them normally.
LOW LIGHT VISION:: 
Gnome eyes amplify light. They ignore penalties for Dim and Dark Illumination.
KEEN SENSES:: 
Gnomes start with a d6 in Notice instead of a d4. This increases their maximum Notice to d12 + 1.
OBSESSIVE:: 
Gnomes start with a d4 in any one Smarts-related skill.
* Repair
REDUCED PACE:: 
Decrease the character’s Pace by 1 and reduce their running die by one die type.
SIZE −1:: 
Averaging roughly three and a half feet tall, gnomes reduce their Size and Toughness by 1.
TOUGH:: 
Gnomes start with a d6 in Vigor instead of a d4. 
This increases maximum Vigor to d12 + 1.
