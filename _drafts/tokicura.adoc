The train is well into the mountains.
The heroes have one sleeping berth (there was only one left) and 3 seats in the passenger coach.

The coach is quite full of passengers, some sleeping and some occupying themselves with games and conversation.
There is luggage and animals in the coach.

And the things get interesting.

// Do I give the heroes a chance to hear the Nazi mountaineers board the train? 
// Maybe they get a chance to seem if something is amiss but that might not be fun.

It is evening, just after sundown.
The train has been climbing the mountains for a few hours now.
The train enters a tunnel and the train continues in that tunnel for over a minute.
When the train goes through the tunnel, the train's interior is even darker. 
The passengers cross themselves and make gestures to ward off bad luck, and then they continue about their business.
But then the train slows in the tunnel. 
Passengers react with consternation.
A train conductor moves through the coach toward the front of the train, acting casual and saying "Do not be alarmed. Our engineer is a most cautious man. We are in the best hands. I will be right back."

____
Senors and Senoras, I am Major Otto Stampfer of the German army.
You have my sincere apologies for this interruption to your journey.
I have one request and then you may continue with your journey unmolested.
I am looking for a young lady of Mapuche descent, a Senorita Licarayen.
Where is she?
____

No one answers.

Stampfer waits briefly, draws his pistol, and shoots an elderly man.

Screamimng erupts from the passengers.

Stampfer ends the screaming by firing his bullet into the roof of the train.

[quote, Stampfer, continues monologue]
____
Enough! 
This lady must reveal herself to me or someone must point out this young woman.
While I wait, I will shoot a passenger every minute.
And just to be sure I do not shoot this young lady, I will start by shooting the men.
