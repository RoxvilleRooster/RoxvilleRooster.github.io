= Lean SWADE

* If player characters can use powers, you increase play complexity and game latency (slowness).
Arcane backgrounds, powers, and even complex devices,  are more complex than most traits and edges. 
+ 
There are plenty of ways you can create interesting PCs in Savage Worlds without powers and arcane backgrounds
* Players like powers and arcane backgrounds, so most settings need to support players with those interests but they do not need to part of every setting.
Savage Worlds is a toolbox - use the tools you need and leave others out.
