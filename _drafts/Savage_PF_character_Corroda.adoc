== Hindrances

Major:: Code of Honor
Minor:: Cautious
Minor:: Phobia (ophidiophobia - fear of snakes)

== Edges

FIGHTER::
// REQUIREMENTS: Novice, Strength d6+, Fighting d6+
Class "edge" (free at {chargen})

// BRAVE:: 
// REQUIREMENTS: Novice, Spirit d6+
// Those with this Edge have learned to master their fear, or have dealt with so many horrors they’ve become jaded. 
// These valiant explorers add +2 to Fear checks and subtract 2 from Fear Table results (see page 152).
BRAWNY:: 
// REQUIREMENTS: Novice, Strength d6+, Vigor d6+
Your bruiser is very large or very fit. 
Her Size increases by +1 (and therefore Toughness by 1) and she treats her Strength as one die type higher when determining Encumbrance (page 106) and Minimum Strength to use armor, weapons, and equipment without a penalty (page 106).
Brawny can’t increase a character’s Size above +3, and it has no effect on Armor Interference or Armor Restriction.

== Class Special Abilities

MARTIAL FLEXIBILITY:: 
Once per encounter, as a free action, a fighter can choose to gain the benefits of a single Combat Edge. 
He must meet all of the Edge’s Requirements, and the benefits of the chosen Edge end after five rounds.

== Gear


Starting wealth:: 300 GP
Current Wealth:: TBD
