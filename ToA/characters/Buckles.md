### Favour 
To gain Favour, you must take action promoting, enacting or adhering to one or more tenets. 
The GM determines whether a tenet is met and Favour bestowed. 
You either have Favour or not. 
Acting contrary to a tenet generally strips the cultist of Favour if they have it (GM’s call, or a Luck (Cha) save may be called for). Consistently breaking tenets not only strips favour, but may impose penalties on invoking blessings, or prevent any blessings until/if the  cultist atones (GM's call).

If labouring under a Divine Rebuke (p.96) that requires Atonement to absolve, the cultist cannot gain Favour until their atonement is complete.
Because cultists rely on Favour to invoke blessings reliably and without fear of Divine Rebuke, it is recommended that GMs give PCs the benefit of the doubt when deciding whether a tenet is satisfied. 
At the GM's option however, repeatedly using the same tenet to garner Favour may become increasingly difficult over the course of an adventure.

### Invoke a Blessing

To invoke a Blessing:
* The Cultist must speak clearly, and have line of sight to the target.
* If the Cultist has Favour, they may spend it to automatically invoke the blessing. 
If a spell like effect is involved, make a Will (Divine Lore*) check instead of Int (Arcane Lore*) to determine the spell result. 
Treat a failure as an ordinary success instead.
* If the Cultist does not spend Favour, a Will (Divine Lore*) check is required and treated like a spell casting check. 
If a DDM effect (p.92) triggers, roll on the Divine Rebuke table instead of the DDM table.
