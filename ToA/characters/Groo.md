## Abilities
* **Ferocious Rage** - As a barbarian you may harness a primal and ferocious rage, transforming you into a fearsome and bloodthirsty combatant.
You begin an adventure with one use of this ability per level. 
Unless noted otherwise, you may expend a use of this ability as part of your normal action to rage. 
When you do so, choose one effect from the list below to apply. If an effect requires a Con check, you may use a Reroll.
Your rage may be loud (bellowing, etc) or quiet (burning glare, etc) which you decide each time you invoke it. 
You may regain expended uses by taking Short or Long Rests.
    * Gain a +2 bonus on melee attack and damage
rolls, and Luck rolls. 
Also reroll any fumbled
attacks. 
These effects last a number of rounds
equal to your Con modifier.
    * If you fail a Str check attempting a feat of physical power (excluding attacks), you may reroll it (does not cost a Reroll).
    * Once per combat, when you suffer damage, you may trigger your rage to reduce that damage by half. 
    * Once per target, after causing damage with a melee weapon, you may attempt a Con check to also inflict a relevant Trauma roll. 
    * When you are subject to a mental effect (magical or otherwise) such as fear, charm, confusion, or compulsion, you may trigger your rage to attempt a Con check to negate it.
Madness cannot be negated using this ability.
* **Wild Born** - At 1st level, your athleticism and survival skills grant you adv on Wilderness Lore checks, light armour grants +3 AC* instead of +1 AC, and you ignore skill penalties for medium armour (p.61).
