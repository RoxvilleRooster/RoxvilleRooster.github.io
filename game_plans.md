The end goal is that we all have fun. This is our leisure time.* To encourage and help other aspiring GMs.## Savage Worlds* I'll be using Savage Worlds Deluxe Explorer's Edition (SWDEE).* I want to keep  houseruling to a minimum, but we will borrow rules from other settings.* Before we begin a campaign, we will determine the setting rules.* At first, I do not expect players to know the Savage Worlds rules; I will assume gamers have a licensed copy of the SWDEE (an affordable $10 USD).### Game systems I have GMed* Savage Worlds* Pathfinder* Pendragon* GURPS* AD&D 1e* Top Secret* Villains & Vigilantes* RuneQuest* Star Frontiers* Twilight 2000* Star Wars (WEG)### Other game systems I have played* Labyrinth Lord* Hackmaster* Call of Cthulhu* Toon* Star Trek### Other game systems I own* Hero Wars and Hero Quest* Fate Core and Fate Accelerated* Dungeon World## What you can expect* Bring your imagination and a willingness to narrate/add to the story. * We're playing on a virtual tabletop (likely Roll20); I am not going to over-invest in visual aids unless they are especially evocative.* I like to change up technology to try new tools for communication.* You will be asked to provide feedback after gaming sessions; my goal is to improve as a GM* Learn the Roll20 technology for Savage Worlds players * Read and heed the tabletop creed![tabletop-creed](http://fragsandbeer.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/TabletopCreed.jpg)## Settings of interest* Day After Ragnarok* East Texas University, Pinebox, and Savage Joe Lansdale Adventures* Lankhmar* Acthung!
