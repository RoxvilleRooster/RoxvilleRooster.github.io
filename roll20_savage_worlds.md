# Basic stuff
* Wounds: We link the red circle overlay for the token with the Wounds attribute on the character sheet
* Fatigue: We link the green circle overlay for the token with the Fatigue attribute on the character sheet
* Power points: We link the blue circle overlay for the token with the Power Points attribute on the character sheet
* Bennies: We use a special deck of Tokens for these
* Initiative: We deal cards for the turn order. If you have an edge of other modifier that effects cards, make sure it is known to the GM. If the GM forgets, remind him.
