## Tests

To perform a Test, you describe the action and work with the GM to determine the appropriate skill. 
You then make the skill roll and the defender makes an opposed roll to resist using the attribute that the skill is linked to.
Examples:
* Tripping someone  is an Athletics roll and the defender resists with Agility.
* Verbally humiliating a foe is a Taunt roll and the defender resists with Smarts.

If the attacker wins the opposed roll, she can choose to make the foe Distracted or Vulnerable. If she wins with a raise, the target is also Shaken.

_No longer available on Drive Thru RPG_


## Changes to core rules from Flash Gordon

## New states

* Vulnerable: Actions and attacks against the target are made at +2. Does not stack with the Drop (use only the highest).
* Entangled: The character can’t move and is Distracted.
* Bound: The character cannot move, is Distracted and Vulnerable, and cannot make physical actions other than attempting to break free.


### Athletics (Agility)

Athletics includes such physical skills as climbing, jumping, balancing, skiing, swimming, throwing, and catching. 
It also covers skills of hand-eye coordination and the use of core strength to perform bodily maneuvers.
Athletics is also used in grappling.

### Knowledge (Smarts)

Common knowledge skills are
* Academia: catch-all knowledge skill that applies to liberal arts, psycho-social sciences, history, archeology, linguistics, anthropology, and related fields.
* Battle: tactics, strategy, military history and used when the Mass Battles rules are engaged
* Medicine: diagnose disease, know anatomy, analyze forensic evidence, identify pharmaceutical
* Occult: understanding of supernatural lore, creatures of myth and legend, religious practices and mysteries, and magical practices.
* Science: familiarity with major fields of science for his day and age (e.g., chemistry, biology, physics, engineering, mathematics, botany, astronomy)
 
### Performance (Spirit)
Characters can use performance skill to sing, dance, play instruments, or otherwise
entertain crowds. 

### Thievery (Agility)
The thievery skill is used to perform actions involving lockpicking and safecracking, picking pockets and sleight of hand, setting and
disabling traps, and similar acts of misdirection, sabotage, subterfuge, and manipulation. 

## Combat options

### Extreme range
A character who takes the Aim maneuver may disregard the +2 bonus to instead fire at Extreme Range (up to 4× a weapon’s Long
Range), at a −8 penalty (or −6 with a scope). This applies to personal and vehicle-based weapons.

### Grappling

Grappling is an opposed Athletics roll and causes no damage. If the attacker
wins, the defender is Entangled. If the attacker
succeeds with a raise, the defender is Bound. Also, a grappling success against a defender who is already Entangled makes the defender Bound. 

The character must make an opposed Strength roll as an action to break free from the Entangled or Bound states.

If an Entangled character is successful, he’s free and can act normally. 
If a Bound succeeds, he improves to Entangled state on. if he succeeds with a raise, he’s free and can act normally.

If the attacker (aka the grappler on the offensive) is shaken (and does not drop a benny to unshake immediately, the defender immediately is released from the grapple.

An attacker can apply damage to a defender who is Entangled or Bound by making an opposed strength roll as an action on her turn. 
Success means the attack does his strength die in damage. 
Success with a raise means the attack does strength + the standard bonus damage for a raise (typically d6).

A character with the Martial Artist Edge may use Fighting instead of Athletics in grappling contests.
