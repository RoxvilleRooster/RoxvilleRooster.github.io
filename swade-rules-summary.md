## Updates to Savage Worlds rules for SWADE

A more official summary is also posted in the [Pinnacle forums](https://www.pegforum.com/forum/savage-worlds/savage-worlds-general-chat/12025-savage-worlds-adventure-edition%E2%80%94general-feedback?fbclid=IwAR1NyaJsaxRYiQYujPiv5OFpC9DBC9XXTNGK8nLtiS6qJeICUVziEdElUXw){:target="_blank"}.

### Core skills

Every _reasonable_ character gets the following core skills at a d4 for no cost:
* Athletics (Agility)
* Common Knowledge (Smarts)
* Notice (Smarts)
* Persuasion (Spirit)
* Stealth (Agility)

See [Savage Worlds Kickstarter: “Core Skills” Rules Preview!](https://www.peginc.com/savage-worlds-kickstarter-core-skills-rules-preview/){:target="_blank"}.

### Charisma

See [Savage Worlds Kickstarter: Two Final Rules Previews!](https://www.peginc.com/savage-worlds-kickstarter-two-final-rules-previews/){:target="_blank"}.

### Support rules

See [Savage Worlds Kickstarter: “Support” Rules Preview!](https://www.peginc.com/savage-worlds-kickstarter-support-rules-preview/){:target="_blank"}.


### Multiple actions

See [Savage Worlds Kickstarter: Two Final Rules Previews!](https://www.peginc.com/savage-worlds-kickstarter-two-final-rules-previews/){:target="_blank"}.

### Tests

To perform a Test, you describe the action and work with the GM to determine the appropriate skill.
You then make the skill roll and the defender makes an opposed roll to resist using the attribute that the skill is linked to.
Examples:
* Tripping someone  is an Athletics roll and the defender resists with Agility.
* Verbally humiliating a foe is a Taunt roll and the defender resists with Smarts.

If the attacker wins the opposed roll, she can choose to make the foe Distracted or Vulnerable. If she wins with a raise, the target is also Shaken.

### Chase rules

#### Before you begin

Get an extra deck of playing cards (a/k/a the _chase deck_) to use for the chase course. Shuffle the chase deck.

#### Sequence of play for a chase

1. Determine the maneuvering skill for the type of chase:
	* Foot (Athletics)
	* Mounted (Riding)
	* Land vehicle (Driving)
	* Aircraft or spacecraft (Piloting)
	* Watercraft (Boating)
2. Deal a number of _chase cards_ from the chase deck in a row on the table top, from left to right. For most chases, 9 chase cards is enough. Chase card 1 is on the left and chase card 9 (or N) is on the far right.
3. Determine participants in the chase and how they are grouped into units that will take part in the chase independently.
4. Determine the position of the participants at the start of the chase. Place the participants on the chase cards.
5. At the start of the round, deal _action_ cards to each participant to determine the order in which the participants can act.
The characters on each _chase card_ can act in whatever order as their action card comes up (e.g., when multiple character comprise 1 chase participant).
Note: Characters performing a boarding action that are in or on an enemy vehicle get their own _action card_ (as a group).
6. State character actions(s) and then resolve the action(s).



#### Determining chase participants

Everyone in/on the same vehicle (or large mount), for example, is part of a group that comprise a single chase participant.
In a foot chase, each PC typically acts independently (i.e., each PC is a participant) because they move independently.
A group of Extras (e.g., a pack of goblins) can be broken up into one or more groups (each group being a participant) as the GM decides.

The GM decides who’s allowed to participate in a chase.
For example, a kid on a bike might be able to chase bandits in a car if the streets are very congested,
but the kid is left behind after a round on the open road.

#### Determining the initial position of the participants

The rear-most participant is at the back of the chase, on the far left card (i.e., chase card 1).
All other participants are placed to the right of the rear-most participant as fits the circumstances.
The GM determines the position of the participants.
The GM adds more chase cards to the left or the right of a participant. <!-- How does this work in practice? -->

##### Range between participants

The range between participants is the number of chase cards (not counting the chase card on which the attacker sits) multiplied by the range increment.

| Chase type |  Suggested range increment |
| - | - |
| Foot, Mounted, or Vehicular | 5 |
| Airplane or  Marine Vessel | 25 |
| Jets or Starships | 50 |

#### Critical failures

| Chase type | Result |
| - | - |
| Vehicle | Operator rolls on the **Out of Control** table |
| Foot | Roll a die. Even = character loses the rest of his turn (e.g., he stumbles, negotiates an obstacle, or takes a wrong turn); Odd = character suffers 1 Fatigue |
| Mounted | Roll a d6. 1–2: rider loses his turn; 3–4: his mount suffers Fatigue that applies to the animal’s rolls and the rider’s Riding rolls; 5–6: the rider suffers Fatigue (e.g., from a bad bounce, low-hanging obstacle, or overexertion) when trying to control his mount |


#### Ending the chase

A chase ends when the following conditions are true:
* one side gets away (e.g., disabling all pursuers, successfully performs the _Flee_ maneuver)
* one side stops by choice or by force
<!-- How do the chase cards come in here? Don't they matter? -->

##### Actions

* Test
* Support
* Attack
* Use powers
* Hold action (opposed roll to successfully interrupt)
* Perform a _chase maneuver_

**Note**: NPC vehicle crews cannot perform Test or Support rolls.

#### Chase maneuvers

| Maneuver | Type |
| - | - |
| Boarding | Action |
| Change position | Action _or_ Free Action |
| Evade | Free Action |
| Flee | Action |
| Force | Action |
| Hold Steady | Free Action |
| Ram | Action |


#### Complications during a chase

If a character or group’s _action Card_ is a Club, something goes wrong.
The suit on the character or vehicle’s current _chase card_ determines any modifier to the maneuvering roll and the results of failure.

| Suit | Modifier | Failure result |
| - | - | - |
| Joker | +2 | The character or vehicle is Bumped up to two Chase Cards |
| Spades | –2 | The character or vehicle gets Bumped |
| Hearts | -- | Vehicles roll on the **Out of Control** table; runners or mounted riders suffer Fatigue |
| Diamonds | -- | The character or vehicle gets Bumped |
| Clubs | –4 | Vehicles roll on the **Out of Control** table; runners or mounted riders suffer Fatigue |

GMS can trigger special conditions related to complications as they fit the scene and gameplay.

##### Bumping

If a character, vehicle, or group is bumped during a chase, the player inflicting the bump chooses to move the defender one _chase card_ in the direction on t the chase card course that he chooses.
Groups always stay together when a bump occurs.

#### Attacks during a chase

Characters can make attacks provided that the GM agrees that they make sense in the context of the chase.

##### Melee attacks

In foot, mounted, or vehicular chases (where plausible), characters can make melee attacks only when they’re on the same
_chase card_ as their foe. Standard combat modifiers, such as the _gang-up_ bonus, _withdrawing from
melee_, etc., apply as the GM sees fit.
If a character attack a moving vehicle in melee, the vehicle's parry is 2 + half the driver’s
maneuvering skill (e.g., if d8 then 4), plus the vehicle's _handling_ rating.
Melee attacks aren’t usually possible between very fast vehicles, airplanes, starships, etc.

##### Ranged attacks

Drivers and characters can fire ranged weapons.
The range between participants is the number of chase cards (not counting the chase card on which the attacker sits) multiplied by the range increment.
<!-- What about unstable platform penalty and the steady hands edge? -->

##### Damage to characters or mounts

Resolve damage normally but if the character (or his mount) is shaken, _Stunned_, or wounded in a chase, he’s also Bumped.
<!-- Stunned is a state? -->

##### Damage to vehicles

Vehicles cannot be shaken but if damage exceeds a vehicle's toughness (whether it takes a wound or not), the
operator must make a maneuvering roll or go Out of Control (and then roll on the Out of Control table).
During a chase, the vehicle is also Bumped.
Each raise on a vehicular damage roll causes one wound and then you roll on the Vehicle Critical Hits table.
Most vehicles can take three wounds before they’re wrecked. Each wound reduces a vehicle’s Handling by one (to a maximum of −4).

##### Called shots on vehicles

To target a particular location on a vehicle, the GM assigns a modifier based on the size of the target.
See the modifiers for Size and Cover for details. <!-- there is an xref here -->
If the attack is successful and causes a wound, it also causes the effects for that area (see the Vehicle Critical Hit table).

### Quick encounters
See [Adventure Edition Preview: Quick Encounters](https://www.peginc.com/store/adventure-edition-preview-quick-encounters/){:target="_blank"}.

Examples of quick encounters include:

| Quick encounter type | Applicable skills |
| - | - |
| Chase |  Driving, Repair, Shooting, Common Knowledge (e.g., for navigation) |
| Combat | Fighting, Shooting, Spellcasting  |
| Crisis | Athletics, Persuasion (e.g., to calm bystanders), Repair |
| Heist | Notice, Hacking, Stealth, Thievery |
| Mission | Battle, Boating, Fighting, Persuasion, Piloting, Shooting |
| Trek | Common Knowledge, Notice, Survival |

GM considers and then imposes situational modifiers (from -4 penalty to a +4 bonus).
Players go in whatever order they want but they should resolve skill checks in the order that makes sense.
If a critical task is failed, the GM decides whether it ends the encounter or just complicates other (downstream) tasks. For example, a standard combat or a quick combat may result because of a failure.
Some encounters may need additional rounds (a/k/a staged encounters).

Once each player determines the skill and the GM decides on modifiers, the player make the skill check and then works with the GM to narrate the result.

#### Dangerous encounters

| Skill roll result | Effect |
| - | - |
| Critical failure | 1d4 wounds to the PC; if the PC is a driver of a vehicle, the vehicle takes 1d4 wounds |
| Failure | 1 wound to the PC; if the PC is a driver of a vehicle, the vehicle takes 1 wound |
| Success | PC suffers **bumps and bruises** (a/k/a 1 Fatigue) |
| Success with a raise | No negative effects and the PC is "covered in glory" |


#### Nonlethal encounters

| Skill roll result | Effect |
| - | - |
| Critical failure | The PC does not contribute to success and _something bad happens_ that has a lasting effect |
| Failure | The PC does not contribute to success |
| Success | The PC contributes to the success |
| Success with a raise | The PC is "covered in glory" |

#### Success and failure

In general, narration and individual actions determine success and failure.
In a fluid situation (e.g., combat), the group _wins_ if the they have as many successes as there are PCs in the group.

You count 1 success point for a standard success and an additional success point for a success with a raise.

If there are fewer successes than PCs in the group, the group _fails_ and the specifics are up to the GM.


## Changes to core rules from Flash Gordon

### New states

* Distracted: The character suffers −2 to all Trait rolls.
* Vulnerable: Actions and attacks against the target are made at +2. Does not stack with the Drop (use only the highest).
* Entangled: The character can’t move and is Distracted.
* Bound: The character cannot move, is Distracted and Vulnerable, and cannot make physical actions other than attempting to break free.

### Changes to skills

#### Athletics (Agility)

Athletics includes such physical skills as climbing, jumping, balancing, skiing, swimming, throwing, and catching.
It also covers skills of hand-eye coordination and the use of core strength to perform bodily maneuvers.
Athletics is also used in grappling.

#### Knowledge (Smarts)

Common knowledge skills are
* Academia: catch-all knowledge skill that applies to liberal arts, psycho-social sciences, history, archeology, linguistics, anthropology, and related fields.
* Battle: tactics, strategy, military history and used when the Mass Battles rules are engaged
* Medicine: diagnose disease, know anatomy, analyze forensic evidence, identify pharmaceutical
* Occult: understanding of supernatural lore, creatures of myth and legend, religious practices and mysteries, and magical practices.
* Science: familiarity with major fields of science for his day and age (e.g., chemistry, biology, physics, engineering, mathematics, botany, astronomy)

#### Performance (Spirit)
Characters can use performance skill to sing, dance, play instruments, or otherwise
entertain crowds.

#### Thievery (Agility)
The thievery skill is used to perform actions involving lockpicking and safecracking, picking pockets and sleight of hand, setting and
disabling traps, and similar acts of misdirection, sabotage, subterfuge, and manipulation.

### Changes to combat

#### Extreme range
A character who takes the Aim maneuver may disregard the +2 bonus to instead fire at Extreme Range (up to 4× a weapon’s Long
Range), at a −8 penalty (or −6 with a scope). This applies to personal and vehicle-based weapons.

#### Grappling

Grappling is an opposed Athletics roll and causes no damage. If the attacker
wins, the defender is Entangled. If the attacker
succeeds with a raise, the defender is Bound. Also, a grappling success against a defender who is already Entangled makes the defender Bound.

The character must make an opposed Strength roll as an action to break free from the Entangled or Bound states.

If an Entangled character is successful, he’s free and can act normally.
If a Bound succeeds, he improves to Entangled state on. if he succeeds with a raise, he’s free and can act normally.

If the attacker (aka the grappler on the offensive) is shaken (and does not drop a benny to unshake immediately, the defender immediately is released from the grapple.

An attacker can apply damage to a defender who is Entangled or Bound by making an opposed strength roll as an action on her turn.
Success means the attack does his strength die in damage.
Success with a raise means the attack does strength + the standard bonus damage for a raise (typically d6).

A character with the Martial Artist Edge may use Fighting instead of Athletics in grappling contests.
