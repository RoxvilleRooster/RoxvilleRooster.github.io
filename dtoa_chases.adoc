== Chases

There are at least three chases per _Daring Tales of Adventure_ scenario; the _Daring Tales_ chases used different rules from those specified in the _Savage Worlds Deluxe Explorers' Edition_ rules and they are also markedly different from the
_Savage Worlds Adventure Edition_ chase rules.

Wiggy wrote some excellent set piece chase actin scenes.
If you can use these chases with minimal change, I suggest doing so. Some minor changes are needed. For example, if the chase calls for an Agility trait roll to maneuver, you will most likely want to call for the Athletics skill.

There will be cases where you may want to use a Quick Encounter to handle a chase scene. For example, you may want to keep the pace of the game going and move on to the next scene before the session ends.

=== Obstacles and Complications

As per the rules, if the action card that is dealt to a character at the start of a chase round (SWADE p 114) is a club, there's a problems of some kind;  the hero needs to make a maneuvering roll.

In standard chases, you check the chase card suit against the Complications table to determine the mechanical effect of the complication and the hero makes a maneuvering roll (SWADE p 116).

In many of the set-piece chases in _Daring Tales of Adventure_ scenarios, when the action card is a club, the GM refers to the Obstacles listed for the scene, looking up the card value to determine what's next.footnote:[See "Daring Tales of Adventure - The Devil's Chalice",  Act 1, Scene 2.] The obstacle descriptions provide useful narrative color, indicate the maneuvering penalty, and state what happens if the maneuvering roll fails.

In some _Daring Tales of Adventure_ chase scenes, the obstacles and events of a chase are fixed beforehand; the heroes are running a gauntlet.footnote:[See "Daring Tales of Adventure - The Talons of Lo-Peng",  Act 2, Scene 3.]

At the fixed event points (called increments) in the chase, stuff happens when the heroes reach that increment, no matter if they pass that stage or not.
If the scene defines 20 increments, lay down 20 chase cards. Use some kind of counter to mark the increments on which fixed events occur.
