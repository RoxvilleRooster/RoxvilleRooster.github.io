## Pursuits
See [Pursuits](http://savage-stuff.blogspot.com/2017/08/situational-rule-pursuits.html).

Each pursuit is divided into six range steps.
These steps are marked on a Pursuit Chart.
1. close (melee attack, ranged attack)
2. short (ranged attack)
3. medium (ranged attack)
4. long
5. extreme
6. trailing

### Initiating a pursuit

To run, announce your intent to escape.
"Escape" maneuver requires a successful Athletics roll (or applicable maneuvering skill) as a full-round action.
On a success, character attracks free attacks for disengaging from combat.

To pursue, announce your intent to pursue.
The pursuer moves to the short step on the Pursuit Chart.

In a vehicular pursuit, only the driver is tracked on the chart for the purposes of the pursuit.

### Process

1. Draw an action card at the start of each round.
If you have a higher action card, you act before (or after) others with lower cards.
You may want to act later in a round after you've observed your opponent's action.

2. Perform a pursuit maneuver on your turn as a normal action. 
The following other actions are permitted:
attacks, support rolls, tests, spellcasting, etc., at the GM's discretion. 
If you wish to perform multiple actions, you take the multi-action penalty.

**Note**: It is assumed that characters are _always_ moving during a pursuit.

If you don't perform any pursuit maneuvers, you are still pursuing or fleeing, 
but you don't make any progress relative to your opponent during the round.

At the end of the round, if you are in the _trailing_ step, you drop out of the pursuit.

### Pursuit maneuvers

To perform a pursuit maneuver, you use an applicable "maneuvering skill" (athletics, riding, driving, piloting).
A pursuit maneuver is a normal action.
You can perform a no more than one pursuit maneuver on your turn, but you can perform other actions.

#### Maneuvers for pursuers

* **Pursue** Make a maneuvering skill roll to move one step closer on the Pursuit Chart. 
If you end up at at close range, you may also chose to move into close combat.
Your opponent provokes a free attack if they continue running. 
When you chase someone with a higher pace/speed, 
you suffer a -1 penalty to your roll, or -2 if their Pace is twice yours or greater. 
If your Pace is higher than theirs, you gain a +1 bonus to your roll, or +2 if your Pace is at least twice theirs.

* **Drive (or force)** Make an opposed maneuvering skill roll against your target to drive them in a particular direction. 
You can only use this maneuver at close range or short ranges.
On a success, pursuers at long, extreme, or trailing range can immediately use the pursue maneuver as a free action.

**Note**: You cannot make more than one free pursue maneuver each round. 

When you chase someone with a higher pace/speed, 
you suffer a -1 penalty to your roll, or -2 if their Pace is twice yours or greater. 
If your Pace is higher than theirs, you gain a +1 bonus to your roll, or +2 if your Pace is at least twice theirs.

* **Lookout**: Make an Atheltcis roll to clamber up a tree, onto a rooftop, etc. 
You move one step further away on the Pursuit Chart but you can make a support rokll (e.g., to shout directions to your allies)
and giving them an additional +1 to their pursue maneuvers as long as you maintain your vantage point.
This doesn’t stack with the bonus from other lookouts. 
At the GM's discretion, you can continue the pursuit (e.g., by jumping from roof to roof) but 
you suffer a -2 penalty to your pursue maneuvers while doing pursuing from lookout position. 
You can jump down again as a free action.



#### Maneuvers for the pursued

* **Flee** Make a maneuvering trait roll to move everyone on your Pursuit Chart one step further away, or two steps if they have half your Pace or lower. Pursuers with twice your Pace or higher are not normally affected by this maneuver, unless you’re able to take a route they cannot directly follow (perhaps because they’re larger than you, or riding a mount). You may take a difficult path if you wish; this gives you a -2 penalty to your trait roll, but everyone chasing you also suffers a -2 penalty to their pursue maneuvers until the beginning of your next turn, unless they are using the lookout maneuver to pursue you.

* **Hide** You attempt to lose your pursuers by ducking into an alleyway or finding some other hiding spot. Make an opposed Stealth roll against your pursuers' Notice, those at long range receive a +2 bonus to their rolls, while those at medium range receive a +4 bonus. This maneuver cannot be used if you have any pursuers at close or short range. Any pursuers who succeed their Notice rolls are immediately moved to close range, but if none succeed then you escape. If you are fleeing multiple pursuers, those who succeeded their Notice rolls can shout a warning to the others, who are moved to medium range.

* **Backtrack** You wait until your pursuers get close, then rush past them in the opposite direction. Make a maneuvering trait roll, each pursuer makes an opposed roll against it: those who succeed receive a free attack at close range. If you manage to get away, all pursuers who won the opposed roll are moved to medium range, while those who failed are moved to long range. You can attack at close range while passing your pursuers if you wish, applying the usual multiaction penalty.
