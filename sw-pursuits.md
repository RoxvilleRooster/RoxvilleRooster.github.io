## Pursuits
See [Pursuits](http://savage-stuff.blogspot.com/2017/08/situational-rule-pursuits.html) by Richard Woolcock.

Each pursuit is divided into six range steps.
These steps are marked on a Pursuit Chart.

| Range Step | Permitted Attacks | Pursuit Maneuvers | Pursued Maneuvers |
| - | - | - | - |
| Close | Melee, Ranged | Pursue, Drive, Lookout | Backtrack, Flee  |
| Short | Ranged | Pursue, Drive, Lookout  | Backtrack, Flee |
| Medium | Ranged | Pursue, Lookout | Flee, Hide |
| Long | Ranged* | Pursue, Lookout  | Flee, Hide |
| Extreme |  | Pursue, Lookout | Flee, Hide |
| Trailing |  | Pursue, Lookout | Flee, Hide |



### Initiating a pursuit

To run, start by announcing your intention to escape.
The _escape_ combat maneuver requires a successful Athletics roll (or applicable maneuvering skill) as a full-round action.
On a success, you attract free attacks for disengaging from combat.

To pursue, announce your intent to pursue.
The pursuer moves to the short step on the Pursuit Chart.

In a vehicular pursuit, only the driver is tracked on the chart for the purposes of the pursuit.

### Process

1. Draw an action card at the start of each round as if it were initiative.
If you have a higher action card, you act before (or after) others with lower cards.
You may want to act later in a round after you've observed your opponent's action.

2. Perform a pursuit maneuver on your turn as a normal action. 
The following other actions are permitted at the GM's discretion: 
attacks, support rolls, tests, spell-casting. 
If you wish to perform multiple actions, you must declare them up front and take the multi-action penalty on your actions.

**Note**: It is assumed that characters are _always_ moving during a pursuit.

If you don't perform any pursuit maneuvers, you are still pursuing or fleeing, 
but you don't make any progress relative to your opponent during the round.

At the end of the round, if you are in the _trailing_ step, you drop out of the pursuit.

### Pursuit maneuvers

To perform a pursuit maneuver, you use an applicable "maneuvering skill" (athletics, riding, driving, piloting).
A pursuit maneuver is a normal action.
You may perform only one pursuit maneuver on your turn but you may perform other actions.

#### Maneuvers for pursuers

* **Pursue** Make a maneuvering roll to move one step closer on the Pursuit Chart. 
If you end up at the _close_ step, you may also chose to move into close combat.
Your opponent provokes a free attack if they continue running as if they are disengaging from melee. 
When you chase someone with a higher pace/speed, 
you suffer a -1 penalty to your roll, or -2 if their Pace is twice yours or greater. 
If your Pace is higher than theirs, you gain a +1 bonus to your roll, or +2 if your Pace is at least twice theirs.

* **Drive (or force)** Make an opposed maneuvering roll against your target to drive (force) them in a particular direction. 
You can only use this maneuver when you are in the _close_ or _short_ steps.
On a success, other pursuers at long, extreme, or trailing range can immediately use the pursue maneuver as a free action.

**Note**: You cannot make more than one free pursue maneuver each round. 

When you chase someone with a higher pace/speed, 
you suffer a -1 penalty to your roll, or -2 if their Pace is twice yours or greater. 
If your Pace is higher than theirs, you gain a +1 bonus to your roll, or +2 if your Pace is at least twice theirs.

* **Lookout**: Make an Athletics roll to clamber up a tree, onto a rooftop, etc. 
You move one step further away on the Pursuit Chart but you can make a support roll (e.g., to shout directions to your allies)
and giving them an additional +1 to their pursue maneuvers as long as you maintain your vantage point.
This doesnâ€™t stack with the bonus from other lookouts. 

At the GM's discretion, you can continue the pursuit (e.g., by jumping from roof to roof) but 
you suffer a -2 penalty to your pursue maneuvers while pursuing from a lookout position. 
You can jump down as a free action.



#### Maneuvers for the pursued

* **Flee** Make a maneuvering roll to move everyone on your Pursuit Chart 1 step further away (success) 
or 2 steps if they have half your Pace or lower. 
Pursuers with twice your Pace or greater are not affected by this maneuver unless you get a raise 
(e.g., you find a route that your pursuer cannot directly follow). 
If you choose to _take a difficult path_, you suffer a -2 penalty to your maneuvering roll but 
your pursuers also suffer a -2 penalty to their pursue maneuvers until the beginning of your next turn 
_unless_ your pursuers are using the lookout maneuver.

* **Hide** You attempt to lose your pursuers by ducking into an alleyway or finding some other hiding spot. 
Make an opposed Stealth roll against your pursuers' Notice. 
If you are pursued and your pursuers are at the _long_ step, the pursuers get a +2 bonus to their Notice rolls.
If you are pursued and your pursuers are at the _medium_ step,the pursuers get a +4 bonus to their Notice rolls. 
You cannot use this maneuver if you have pursuers at the _close_ or _short_ step. 
Any pursuers who succeed their Notice rolls are immediately moved to the _close_ step.
If no pursuers succeed their Notice rolls, you escape. 
If you are fleeing multiple pursuers, those pursuers who succeeded their Notice rolls may shout a warning to the other pursuers, 
and these pursuers are then moved to the _medium_ step.

* **Backtrack** You wait until your pursuers get close, then rush past them in the opposite direction. 
Make a maneuvering roll and each pursuer makes an opposed roll against it.
Pursuers who succeed receive a free attack at the _close_ step. 
If you manage to get away, all pursuers who succeeded the opposed roll are moved to the _medium_ step. 
All pursuers who failed are moved to the _long_ step. 
You can attack at the _close_ step while passing your pursuers but the multi-action penalty applies.
