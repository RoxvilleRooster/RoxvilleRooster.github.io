== Setting rules


Assuming that you are playing the crew of a vessel like _Serenity_.

All heroes have the Poverty hindrance. The crew's situation is almost always desperate.

The following setting rules from SWADE are fitting for a Savage Worlds Firefly campaign:

* Conviction (SWADE 136)

Hindrances:

* Outsider (a la Browncoat) - minor
* Clueless (a la Tinhorn/Greenhorn) - major
* Obligation (a la Debt) - minor or major
