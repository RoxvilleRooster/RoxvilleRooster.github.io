What is the sweet spot for VTT gaming?

Avoid combats that are not meaningful or use expedient combat methods (like Savage Worlds' quick combat)

Give interesting hooks for a combat
Set piece encounter and overplanning
versus
improv combat and making the most of the combat location


But how do you 
a think of the scene
b imagine the type of stuff in the scene
c encourage players to do the same
d gamify the scene (know your system)
e handle in a VTT or on TT

Do not worry about populating the VTT scene with "stuff"
blank canvas with some basic dimensions
on VTT, get comfy with the drawing tools
hand the drawing tools to your players (need to use repsonsibly or else you get penises drawn all over)
encourage imagination of players to make it interesting



Some players want/expect/prefer the  visual scene to be all enocmpassing where all is visible on the screen/map/TT.
Having a very descriptive/well populated TT can be very immersive, draw players in 
and it can be very time consusing for the GM and requires set pieces
and that can constrain the game, limit players to what the GM has prepared


I think you want a table that involves 
more imagination
more creativity
more extemporizing

less prep

ask players (or encouarge them to think) what would be in the scene 
try and say yes
	what is common
	whats is possible, unommon, or interesting
	what is improbable (mayeb spend a benny)


Knowing the limits of combat in RPGs

Reality check: video games "co" action and combat scnenes quicker and better than tabletop RPGs
But many of us love combat and action scenes in TT RPGs 
So what do we do to keep TT RPG combat and action scenes entertaining and compelling?

Where I am going -> do you want to go theatre of the mind style on VTT?
No.

Strive for minimalist representation WRT maps
You should not sink GM prep time (or money) working on great set piece maps - wing that stuff and encourage the players to help build the scene
If you are usig a VTT, use tokens and at least a measure tool to do distance.
But keen the slate (map) blank and minimalist as necessary.


So you have a warehouse
it is full of skids 
What is on the skids?
If you have no idea, make it up?
