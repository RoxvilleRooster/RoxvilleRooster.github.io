What is the sweet spot for VTT gaming?

Avoid combats that are not meaningful or use expedient combat methods (like Savage Worlds' quick combat)

* Give interesting hooks for a combat
* Set-piece encounter and overplanning 
_versus_
improv combat and making the most of the combat location


But how do you 
a think of the scene
b imagine the type of stuff in the scene
c encourage players to do the same
d gamify the scene (know your system)
e handle in a VTT or on TT

## Do not worry about populating the VTT scene with "stuff"
* blank canvas with some basic dimensions
* on VTT, get comfy with the drawing tools
* hand the drawing tools to your players (need to use repsonsibly or else you get penises drawn all over)
* encourage imagination of players to make it interesting


Some players want/expect/prefer the  visual scene to be all enocmpassing where all is visible on the screen/map/TT.

Having a very descriptive/well populated TT can be very immersive, draw players in 
_but_
it can be very time consusing for the GM and requires set pieces
and this can also 
constrain the game, limit players to what the GM has prepared


I think you want a table that involves 
* more imagination
* more creativity
* more extemporizing
* less GM prep

Ask players (or encouarge them to think) what would be in the scene 
try and say yes
	* what is common
	* whats is possible, unommon, or interesting
	* what is improbable (maybe spend a benny to put it in the scene)


## Knowing the limits of combat in RPGs

Reality check: video games "do" action and combat scnenes quicker and better than tabletop RPGs
*but* many of us love combat and action scenes in TT RPGs.
So what do we do to keep TT RPG combat and action scenes entertaining and compelling?

Do you want to go theatre of the mind style on VTT? If you have tools that faciliate combat in the VTT, I'd suggest that you avail yourself when it helps your players.

## Strive for minimalist representation WRT maps
You should not sink GM prep time (or money) working on great set piece maps - wing that stuff and encourage the players to help build the scene.
If you are using a VTT, use tokens and at least a measure tool to do distance.
But keep the slate (map) blank and minimalist as necessary.


So you have a warehouse and it is full of skids.  What is on the skids? Forklifts are also in the warehouse.
If you have no idea, make it up?
