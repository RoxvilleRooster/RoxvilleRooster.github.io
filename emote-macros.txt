/em scowls
/em spits on the floor
/em looks inscrutably at the fool who is speaking
/em draws his blade
/em runs his finger along the edge of  blade
/em points a meaty finger at the fool who is speaking
/em unlsings his buckler
/em cocks an eye
/em flashes an evil grin
/em winks
/em shrugs
/em walks away in disgust
/em just walks away
/em sinks into the shadows
/em snickers
/em bites thumb at the speaker
