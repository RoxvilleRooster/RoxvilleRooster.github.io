*You find yourselves in the winding streets and narrow, maze-like alleyways of the the City of Sevenscore Thousand Smokes, Lankhmar. Each step falls lightly on cobblestone, and the sun, even at is zenith, can scarcely penetrate the various smokes and noisome vapors that the city emits.*

We'll run "Swords Drawn in Lankhmar" as a *noir* fantasy pulp game, similar to the tone of Leiber's stories. 

In the initial stages of the street-level mini-campaign, the action takes place in and around Lankhmar. The characters will be drawn into adventures, get thrown story hooks, and be given a chance to play in Leiber's Lankhmar. I also want to encourage players to get involved in the narrative and invent interesting stuff in the city.
 
The player characters need a reason to work together and form casual/unofficial and mutually beneficial partnerships. The charm of the relationship between Fafhrd and the Mouser was the fact that they liked and respected each other, developed a loyalty, and shared a friendly rivalry. I'd like to emulate that in this campaign. Each character needs a reason and a willingness to be working on the margins of the law in the City of the Black Toga.

*Leiber's world contains slaves, whores and pimps, and drinking. Throats get slit and innocent blood is sometimes shed. Anything more sexual than a kiss happens "off screen". The protagonists do not use the profane language of the 21st century English-speaking world but player cussing is not verboten.*
