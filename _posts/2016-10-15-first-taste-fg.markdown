I played a role-playing game in Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) application for the first time and I was struck by how similar the overall experience was with playing using the Roll20 VTT web service.
Neither one strikes me as superior. That is probably really good for all players, because there is some healthy competition.

As a player and GM, I know how to use Roll20 for the Savage Worlds RPG system.
As a player of Savage Worlds, the Fantasy Grounds experience was at least consistent and the game ran quite well. 
As a GM, my hunch is that it is somewhat easier to run most games in Fantasy Grounds than using Roll20, but that needs testing.
After my first use of Fantasy Grounds, I am encouraged enough to play more. 
If you just want to play Savage Worlds game and you mainly play online, you might as well use and learn the main players aspects of both VTTs.
If you resign yourself to playing games in one VTT and not the other, you're going to miss out!
