== Fear

Given the lack of any updated Fright table (RR 31) from the SWADE conversion notes for Rippers Resurrected and the need for a customized table for the setting, I adapted this table for Rippers Resurrected for SWADE. + 
For reference, the Fear Table is on SWADE 124. 

.Fright table
[options="header",cols="1,3"]
|===
| D20* | EFFECT
| 1–3 a| Adrenaline Surge:: The hero’s “fight”
response takes over. +
He acts as if he had a Joker this action!
| 4–5 a| Distracted:: The hero is Distracted
until the end of his next turn.
| 6–7 a| Vulnerable:: The target is Vulnerable until the end of his next turn.
| 9–10 a| Shaken:: The character is Shaken.
// | 13 a| The Mark of Fear:: The hero is Stunned and suffers some cosmetic physical alteration—a white streak forms in his hair, his eyes twitch constantly, or some other minor physical alteration manifests.
| 11–12 a| Frightened:: The character gains the Hesitant Hindrance for the remainder of the encounter. +
If he already has it, he’s Panicked instead.
| 13–14 a| Panicked:: The character immediately moves his full Pace plus running die away from the danger and is Shaken.
| 15-16 a| Paralyzed:: The hero is Shaken and cannot move on his next action.
| 17–18 a| Unhinged:: The character is Shaken and loses one point of Reason. +
Treat as a Breakdown result if the hero is already at zero Reason.
// Minor Phobia:: The character gains a Minor Phobia Hindrance somehow associated with the trauma.
// | 18–19 a| Minor Phobia:: The character gains a Minor Phobia Hindrance somehow associated with the trauma.
| 20–21 a| Traumatized:: The character is Shaken and loses two points of Reason. +
Treat as a Snapped result if the hero is already at zero Reason.
// | 20–21 a| Major Phobia:: The character gains the Major Phobia Hindrance.
// Major Phobia:: The character gains the Major Phobia Hindrance.
| 21–22 a| Breakdown:: The hero is Shaken, loses two points of Reason, and gains a **Minor Psychosis**.*
| 23+ a| Snapped:: The hero is Shaken, loses two points of Reason, and gains a **Major Psychosis**.*
// | 22+ a| Heart Attack:: The hero is so overwhelmed with fear that his heart stutters. He must make an immediate Vigor roll at –2. If successful, he’s Stunned. If he fails, he’s Incapacitated and dies in 2d6 rounds. In the latter case, a Healing roll at –4 saves his life, but he remains Incapacitated. He may be treated normally thereafter.
|===

NOTE: A character with rippertech makes a Spirit roll at –2, with a bonus equal to their current Reason.
On a failure, the character gains ripping psychosis instead of rolling for Temporary Psychosis.
If the psychosis is Major and the hero began with a Reason of 0 (before any loss due to the Table result), the character becomes an nonplayer character villain under the GM’s control on a failed roll.
