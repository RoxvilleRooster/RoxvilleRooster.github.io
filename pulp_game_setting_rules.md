# Special rules for the classic 1930s pulp, two-fisted heroes game


## House rules
### Success with a cost
If you roll a 1 on your skill die but your wild die is successful, that is still considered a success, but there is a negative effect or compromise (e.g., your weapon becomes entangled in an enemy's armor). 
The player can describe what the negative effect looks like. This is derived from Dungeon World mechanic.
I also attribute the idea of applying this type of effect to Savage Worlds to Eric Lamoureux.

### Athletics skill (Strength)
Instead of having separate skills for Swimming and Climbing, we'll use Athletics and link it to the Strength attribute. 
See the discussion on the [PEG forums](http://www.pegforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=21609).

## Setting rules
Download the [Daring Tales of Adventure: Pulp Rules](http://tripleacegames.com/Downloads/DaringTales/TAG31000A_PULP_RULES.pdf) from Triple Ace Games.

We'll be using these rules but we will make the following exceptions:
* For Heroic Combat, we will ignore the Extras' Damage and Nonlethal rules. This will make the enemy extras more of a threat. 

From the Savage Worlds Deluxe Explorer's Edition (p108), we'll also use the following setting rules:
* Born a Hero
* Critical Failures
* Fanatics

### Knock-Out Blows
*From PEG's Deadlands Noir*

When a character takes
enough damage to be Shaken or worse from an opponent
 who has The Drop on him (see Savage Worlds),
he has to make a Vigor roll against the total damage
or be knocked unconscious. If the character Soaks all the
wounds from the damage, he is unaffected. A character who is knocked
unconscious in this manner is out for at least
the remainder of the scene, or possibly longer (GM discretion); what happens during that
time is up to the GM.

### Stunts 
*From Adamant Entertainment's "Thrilling Tales of Adventure"*

Any character who attempts a stunt
action deserves  a
benny.
A stunt
action is any action which
is performed in a
flashier manner
than one would
normally observe.
Getting on board an
airship before it
lifts off from
the platform
is an action.
Leaping from the sidecar of a
speeding motorcycle onto an airship
at the last second as it lifts off from
the platform -- now that is a stunt
action, and should be rewarded.

In game terms, a stunt is an action
where the player purposefully
makes the action more difficult for
the character. In the above example,
the player would have had the option
to get on board the airship, but
instead announced that the character
had gotten there too late, and instead
described the stunt action. In a way,
the player is taking on the role of
the game master for a moment,
changing the situation for his
or her character in such a way
that a more difficult solution is
required. 

A stunt action should always
require a roll, at a minimum
-2 penalty. The game master is the final arbiter of
the roll penalty of a particular stunt
action. Pulling off nearly impossible
stunts (-6 or more to the roll) may even result in the
hero earning more than one benny, at the GM’s discretion.

### Story Declarations 
*From Adamant Entertainment's "Thrilling Tales of Adventure"*

A player may spend a benny and
declare certain details about the
setting and the story. If the Game
Master accepts it, it will be true. This
gives the player the ability to direct
small things in a story, usually
something only the game master
can do.

Declarations cannot be used to
drastically change the plot or to
win a conflict. 

What this can be very useful for
is convenient coincidences. For
example, you can declare that the
storeroom contains
just the right chemicals you need
to build a makeshift explosive, or
you can declare what’s hidden in
your pockets or the fact that you
know someone in a foreign city. Is
there an interesting scene happening
over there that your character might
miss? Spend a benny to declare you
arrive at a dramatically appropriate
moment!

The key limit to Story Declaration
is you cannot contradict previously
established information unless you
come up with some plausible reason
why that information was never true
to begin with!

The GM has final say on Story
Declaration, but generally, if what
you propose makes the game more
interesting, odds are in your favor.
If a proposed declaration isn’t
approved, you keep the benny, and
the change doesn’t happen.


### Mooks
*From Adamant Entertainment's "Thrilling Tales of Adventure"*

Mooks are the level below Extras. Mooks
are the faceless cannon-fodder who
get thrown at the heroes in combat.
The villain will throw these at the
heroes in an effort to slow their
progress, with the off chance that
one or more Mooks might get lucky
and do some damage.

Mooks are just like Extras, but with
the following special rules:
* Every Trait is average (d6).
* They only possess four skills,
and each skill is rated at d6.
* They have no edges and no
hindrances.
* Mooks are never Shaken.
If you equal or exceed their
Toughness, they’re out of the
fight.
Mooks will willingly lay down their
lives for the main villain (see the SWDEE setting rule Fanaticism).

### Defining Interests
*From Reality Blurs' "Realms of Cthulhu"*

In addition to skills and traits, every character has a number
of interests and hobbies that may have nothing to do with their professional pursuits,
or may, at best, complement them on occasion.

Your character begins with a number of defining
interests equal to half of her Smarts die type. Any
permanent increase in a character's Smarts
grants the appropriate number of additional
defining interests that should be selected at the time
of the increase. A defining interest gives the character
a base +1 to their Common Knowledge roll
when the subject is called into question.

#### Sample Interests
Culture: Anthropology, Archaeology, Astrology,
Astronomy, Biology, Botany, City Knowledge
(Specific), Chemistry, Classical Literature, Cooking,
Culture (Specific), Etiquette, Folklore, Forensics,
Geology, Language (Specific), Knowledge (Specific),
Natural History, Photography, Physics

Craft: Art (Specific), Electrical Repair, Mechanical
Repair

Perform: Acting, Comedy, Dance, Disguise,
Juggling, Instrument (Specific), Oratory, Puppetry,
Singing

Languages: Languages
fall under the category of defining interests. An
investigator can automatically speak and (when
appropriate) read and write his native tongue.
Additional languages require the player to choose
the Language interest.

**Note:**
 You can come up with additional items that fit your PC, subject to the GM’s approval. 
A defining interest provides only a
general knowledge of a topic and is not as detailed
as someone who takes a specific Knowledge skill.


### New hindrances
The following hindrances introduced in Adamant Entertainment's "Thrilling Tales of Adventure" are permitted. 

#### Cocky (Minor)
The character is a braggart, and
must spend the first round of any
combat announcing how great he
is, or what he’s going to do to any
and all opponents. This tendency
to boast can be overcome
by spending a benny.

A villain with this hindrance
never delivers a finishing blow
to a foe, but instead will always
somehow leaves the foe the opportunity
to escape.

#### Glass Jaw (Major)
You don’t handle physical pain
and injury well and thus suffer a
–2 penalty on all soak rolls.

#### Obligations (Minor/Major)
The character has duties which
demand a portion of their time
and resources. This can range
from familial obligations (an
elderly relative in your care, for
example, or keeping tabs on the
family’s investments) to sworn
allegiance to an organization
(FBI agents are obligated, as
are Mobsters, but to different
groups). Failure to fulfill such
obligations will have serious re-
percussions -- the severity of the
repercussions determine whether
the Hindrance is a minor or major
one.

A character with Obligations and
Connections to the same organization
has a special relationship
with the group in question
and gains a +2 or +4 bonus to
Persuasion rolls (depending upon
whether their obligations are
minor or major). In essence, the
Connection has a vested interest
in the character and is more
likely to want to see them
succeed.

#### Shellshock (Minor)
The character recovers slowly
from the shock and trauma of
combat, whether due to a delicate
nature or horrible memories of
The Great War. The character
suffers a -2 penalty to Spirit rolls
to recover from being Shaken.

### New Edges
Many of new edges from Adamant Entertainment's "Thrilling Tales of Adventure" are permitted.

#### Combat Sense
Requirements: Seasoned, Fighting d8+, Notice d8+

The character has the perception, skill, and
agility to handle multiple foes. Opponents
halve any Gang Up bonuses against him
(round down).

##### Improved Combat Sense
Requirements: Veteran, Combat Sense

Opponents gain no Gang Up bonus against
this warrior.


#### Dirty Fighter (Combat)
Requirements: Seasoned

The character will do anything
it to win a fight. He adds +2 to all Trick maneuver rolls.


##### Really Dirty Fighter
Requirements: Seasoned, Dirty Fighter

The character is extremely skilled in tactical
deceit. By describing the trick and spending
a benny, he may automatically get the drop
on any single opponent.


#### Gadget (Background)
Requirements: Seasoned

The character has the use of a
single Weird Science device--as
if they had access to the Arcane
Background (Weird Science).
The device is designed as per a
normal Weird Science gizmo,
but utlizes another skill rather
than Weird Science for use (for
example, Piloting or Shooting).

This edge is for character concepts
where the hero has access
to a gizmo, but is not the scientist
who built it --for example, a
down-on-his-luck air circus pilot
who finds a high-tech rocket
pack.

#### Just the Thing (Weird)
Requirements: Wild Card, Luck

Once per session, the character
may “suddenly remember” that
he has a useful piece of gear on
his person. The item must be
able to be carried on the character’s
person, and the GM is the
final arbiter of what can be found.

#### Photographic Memory (Background)
Requirements: Smarts d10+

The character is able to remember
everything they see, hear or
read, down to the tiniest detail.
