## House rules

### Success with a cost
If you roll a 1 on your skill die but your wild die is successful, that is still considered a success, but there is a negative effect or compromise (e.g., your weapon becomes entangled in an enemy's armor). 
The player can describe what the negative effect looks like. This is derived from Dungeon World mechanic.
I also attribute the idea of applying this type of effect to Savage Worlds to Eric Lamoureux.

## Setting rules
Download the [Daring Tales of Adventure: Pulp Rules](http://tripleacegames.com/Downloads/DaringTales/TAG31000A_PULP_RULES.pdf) from Triple Ace Games.

<!--
We'll be using these rules but we will make the following exceptions:

* For Heroic Combat, we will ignore the __Extras' Damage__ and __Nonlethal__ rules. This will make the enemy extras more of a threat. 
-->
From the Savage Worlds Deluxe Explorer's Edition (p108), we'll also use the following setting rules:

* Born a Hero
* Critical Failures
* Fanatics

### Knock-Out Blows
*From PEG's Deadlands Noir*

When a character takes enough damage to be Shaken or worse from an opponent  who has The Drop on him (see Savage Worlds), 
he has to make a Vigor roll against the total damage or be knocked unconscious. If the character Soaks all the wounds from 
the damage, he is unaffected. A character who is knocked unconscious in this manner is out for at least the remainder of the 
scene, or possibly longer (GM discretion); what happens during that time is up to the GM.

### Stunts 
*From Adamant Entertainment's "Thrilling Tales of Adventure"*

Any character who attempts a stunt action deserves a benny. A stunt action is any action which 
is performed in a flashier manner than one would normally observe. 

Conventional action:
* Getting on board an airship before it lifts off from the platform is an action

Stunt action:
* Leaping from the sidecar of a speeding motorcycle onto an airship at the last second as it lifts off from the platform

In game terms, a stunt is an action where the player purposefully makes the action more 
difficult for the character. A stunt action should always require a roll, at a minimum -2 penalty. 
The GM is the final arbiter of the roll penalty of a particular stunt action. Pulling off 
nearly impossible stunts (-6 or more to the roll) may even result in the hero earning 
more than one benny (GM’s discretion).

### Story Declarations 
*From Adamant Entertainment's "Thrilling Tales of Adventure"*

A player may spend a benny and declare certain details about the setting and the story. If the Game Master accepts it, it will be true. This gives the player the ability to direct small things in a story, usually something only the game master can do.

Declarations cannot be used to drastically change the plot or to win a conflict. 

What this can be very useful for is convenient coincidences. For example, you can declare that the storeroom contains just the right chemicals you need to build a makeshift explosive, or you can declare what’s hidden in your pockets or the fact that you know someone in a foreign city. Is there an interesting scene happening over there that your character might miss? Spend a benny to declare you arrive at a dramatically appropriate moment!

The key limit to Story Declaration is you cannot contradict previously established information unless you come up with some plausible reason why that information was never true to begin with!

The GM has final say on Story Declaration, but generally, if what you propose makes the game more interesting, odds are in your favor. If a proposed declaration isn’t approved, you keep the benny, and the change doesn’t happen.


### New skills

##### Athletics (Strength)
The Athletics skill replaces the climbing and swimming skills and is also used when making tests of endurance and foot chase rules. It also applies to jumping. 

#### Replaced skills

The following skills are replaced by Athletics:
* Swimming
* Climbing
Athletics does not replace Throwing.

### New hindrances
Many of the following hindrances introduced in Adamant Entertainment's "Thrilling Tales of Adventure" are permitted. 

#### Cocky (Minor)
The character is a braggart, and must spend the first round of any combat announcing how great he is, or what he’s going to do to any and all opponents. This tendency to boast can be overcome by spending a benny.

A villain with this hindrance never delivers a finishing blow to a foe, but instead will always somehow leaves the foe the opportunity to escape.

#### Glass Jaw (Major)
You don’t handle physical pain and injury well and thus suffer a –2 penalty on all soak rolls.

#### Obligations (Minor/Major)
The character has duties which demand a portion of their time and resources. This can range from familial obligations (an elderly relative in your care, for example, or keeping tabs on the family’s investments) to sworn allegiance to an organization (FBI agents are obligated, as are Mobsters, but to different groups). Failure to fulfill such obligations will have serious re- percussions -- the severity of the repercussions determine whether the Hindrance is a minor or major one.

A character with Obligations and Connections to the same organization has a special relationship with the group in question and gains a +2 or +4 bonus to Persuasion rolls (depending upon whether their obligations are minor or major). In essence, the Connection has a vested interest in the character and is more likely to want to see them succeed.

#### Shellshock (Minor)
The character recovers slowly from the shock and trauma of combat, whether due to a delicate nature or horrible memories of The Great War. The character suffers a -2 penalty to Spirit rolls to recover from being Shaken.

### New Edges
Many of new edges from Adamant Entertainment's "Thrilling Tales of Adventure" are permitted.


#### Bring it on! (Combat)
Requirements: Seasoned, Fighting d10+

The character is a master of defending
against multiple attackers.
Opponents get no Gang Up
bonus against this character.

<!--
#### Combat Sense
Requirements: Seasoned, Fighting d8+, Notice d8+

The character has the perception, skill, and agility to handle multiple foes. Opponents halve any Gang Up bonuses against him (round down).

##### Improved Combat Sense
Requirements: Veteran, Combat Sense

Opponents gain no Gang Up bonus against this warrior.
-->

#### Dirty Fighter (Combat)
Requirements: Seasoned

The character will do anything it to win a fight. He adds +2 to all Trick maneuver rolls.


##### Really Dirty Fighter
Requirements: Seasoned, Dirty Fighter

The character is extremely skilled in tactical deceit. By describing the trick and spending a benny, he may automatically get the drop on any single opponent. 

#### Gadget (Background)
Requirements: Seasoned

The character has the use of a single Weird Science device--as if they had access to the Arcane Background (Weird Science). The device is designed as per a normal Weird Science gizmo, but utlizes another skill rather than Weird Science for use (for example, Piloting or Shooting).

This edge is for character concepts where the hero has access to a gizmo, but is not the scientist who built it --for example, a down-on-his-luck air circus pilot who finds a high-tech rocket pack.


#### Iron Jaw (Combat)

Requirements: Vigor d8+

The character can shrug off the
mightiest of blows, receiving a +2
bonus to Soak rolls.


#### Just the Thing (Weird)
Requirements: Wild Card, Luck

Once per session, the character may “suddenly remember” that he has a useful piece of gear on his person. The item must be able to be carried on the character’s person, and the GM is the final arbiter of what can be found.

#### Photographic Memory (Background)
Requirements: Smarts d10+

The character is able to remember everything they see, hear or read, down to the tiniest detail.


#### Font of Information (Professional)
Requirements: Seasoned, Smarts d8+
The character may make a Common Knowledge roll at +2 to see whether he knows some relevant information 
about anything - local notable people, legendary items, or
noteworthy places - regardless of how specialized or obscure the knowledge.

_As this is an overpowered edge, consult the GM before you add it to a character._
