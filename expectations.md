# When we're playing Savage Worlds

* You'll get bennies for trying to do cool things, making the game fun and interesting, playing according to the tone, and playing hindrances
* We're playing on a virtual tabletop (likely Roll20); I am not planning to over-invest in visual aids unless they are especially evocative.
* Learn the Roll20 technology for Savage Worlds players; you do not need to know Roll20 when your first join
* Bring your imagination and a willingness to narrate/add to the story
* Be engaged during the game session and do your best to pay attention
* Share the stage so your fellow players can shine
* Plan to make the game entertaining, interesting, and challenging
* Give the GM feedback on what is working well and what needs work
* If you have any rules for your character's schticks (e.g., arcane powers or gambling), learn them (or at least have the rules handy)
* If you cannot attend the game at the specified time, give reasonable advanced notice
* Engage in a adult conversation if we ever need to course correct
* Be open to trying new tools for communication (e.g., Slack, Google Spaces, Discord)
* Read and heed the tabletop creed

# Savage Worlds rules

We'll be using Savage Worlds Deluxe Explorer's Edition (SWDEE)
* Where possible, we want to follow the "Fast, Furious, and Fun" model
* I want to keep houseruling to a minimum, but we will borrow rules from other settings.
* Before we begin a campaign, we will determine the setting rules.
* At first, I do not expect new players to know the Savage Worlds rules
* Characters will be awarded an average of 2 XP per session; if you miss a session, you get no experience
* After a few sessions, I expect players to have a licensed copy of the SWDEE (an affordable $10 USD).

# Goals

As a GM and player, I have these goals:

* To build some memorable gaming stories together
* Make the game fun, or at least interesting, for all involved
* To become a better GM; to develop as player
* To encourage and help other players and aspiring GMs
