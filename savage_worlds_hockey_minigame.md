Savage Worlds Hockey Rules

Leverage the mass battle rules (SWDEE 106-7)

Better team gets 10 tokens
Opposing team gets proportional number of tokens (typically 9 or 8).
The tokens are determined by the GM and are an assessment of the aggregate of the team's ability.

Each coach makes a Knowledge (Hockey) trait test.
This can be assisted by 1 of the 2 assistant coaches or the team captain.

Knowledge (Hockey) modifiers:

Coaching Strategy:

Advantage
Each success in Knowledge Hockey represents an advantage to one team, but that does not necessarilly mean a goal. 
It can equate to a momentum surge or shift in the game.

Morale
Each round in which a team loses advantage, the head coach or team captain must make a Knowledge (Hockey) trait test.
This test can be assisted by an assistant coach or another player.

With a success the team battles on; with a failure the team loses composure and the game. 
This losing team gets one more Knowledge (Hockey) roll: success means the loss is respectable; failure means the losing team was blown out.

Morale modififers:

Mod		Situation
-1 		For each token lost in the game so far
+2		The team is playing at home








Characters in hockey games


The stars of your hockey games are the players and named (wild card) NPCs.
All player characters make a roll against a suitable trait or skill.
The player cannot make the same trait test more than once during a game.
Modifiers: 
Add or subtract the number of token difference between the PCs' side and the their opponent.
Add +1 for each ran the hockey player has above novice.

Results:
Failure: The hockey player plays badly and gets banged up. Make a Vigor roll: faiklure means he earns 2 fatiguel; success means her earns 1 fatgiue.
Success: The hockey player played a solid game and adds +1 to the team's Knowledge (Hockey) roll. He earns 1 fatigue.
Raise: The hockey player plays a great game and adds +2 to the team's Knowledge (Hockey) roll.
Each raise over the first: The hockey player looks puts on a legendeary display of hockey prowess; add +1 to the team's Knowledge (Hockey) roll for each raise over the first.
For example, if the hockey star gets 2 raises, add +4 to the team's Knowledge (Hockey) roll (that is, +2 for the first raise and +1 for each additional raise = +4).

When one side loses composure and breaks down (see morale) or runs out of tokens, the game ends.



Everything is harder to do on ice.
Folks who have never been on ice cannot skate and have a -4 to do anything on ice.
Folks who can skate a few laps have a -2 to anything hockey related on ice.

All hockey players require either the "Hockey Skater" or "Hockey Goalie" edge.

A hockey player character with the "Hockey Skater" suffers no penalties to any hockey-related skill or trait tests. This player cannot play the goaltender position.

A hockey player character with the "Improved Hockey Skater" can allocate 2 bonuses to his hockey-related traits or skills for the purposes of hockey only. 
For example, Alexander Bure takes the "Improved Hockey Skater"  edge adds +1 to Hockey Shooting and +1 to Ice Skating (aka Agility), or just +2 to his Hockey Shooting.
The "Improved Hockey Skater" edge can be taken multiple times.

A hockey player character with the "Hockey Goalie" edge suffers no penalties to any hockey-related skill or trait tests, but he cannot play forward or defense positions.
"Hockey Goalie" uses Agility and Spirit trait tests to influence the results of the game.
A hockey player character with the "Improved Hockey Goalie" can allocate 2 bonuses to his hockey-related traits for the purposes of hockey only. 
For example, Brent Malarchuk takes the "Improved Hockey Goalie"  edge adds +2 to his Hockey Spirt or +1 to his Hockey Spirit and +1 to his Hockey Agility.
The "Improved Hockey Goalie" edge can be taken multiple times.
