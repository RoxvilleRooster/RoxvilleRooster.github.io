== Short VTT sessions and benny refresh
Our VTT sessions typically last 2 to 2.5 hours whereas a conventional physical tabletop session tends to run 4 to 5 hours.
In this campaign, 2 VTT sessions equal 1 _session_ in SWADE. As a result, bennies refresh on sessions with odd numbers.

For example:

* VTT session 1 - start with full bennies
* VTT session 2 - bennies do not refresh
* VTT session 3 - bennies are refreshed at session start
* VTT session 4 - bennies do not refresh
* VTT session 3 - bennies are refreshed at session start
* and so on
