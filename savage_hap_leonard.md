# Adapting Joe R. Lansdale's Hap and Leonard for the Savage Worlds RPG

_This is a work in progress_

Hap Collins and Leonard Pine are the main characters in series of novels and
short stories by Joe R. Lansdale. In 2016, the Sundance network released a
six-part TV series that covers the novel "Savage Season".

The point of this page is to describe the characters from the stories for the
Savage Worlds Roleplaying Game.

## Being a Joe R. Lansdale fan


Joe Lansdale writes some fun, evocative yarns. Thanks to Bruce Campbell and the movie version of Bubba Ho-Tep, I found Champion Joe. I will not claim I have read all of Joe's stuff (the master is prolific) but I have read most of everything related to the Hap and Leonard series. To me, Hap and Leonard are similar to Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser.   

## Being a Savage Worlds gamer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
When I came back to tabletop role-playing games in my early forties, I soon found Savage Worlds (after an initial foray into Pathfinder). Savage Worlds is my system of choice nowadays because it is versatile and fast. There is also enough crunch in the rules to satisfy my old-schooly wants.                                                                                                                                                

## Savage Worlds and Joe Lansdale's East Texas                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
In 2015, Pinnacle Entertainment Group came out with the East Texas University (ETU) setting, which is a mash up where Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Miskatonic University, and Blue Mountain State meet in Lansdale country. There is even a building named after Champion Joe on the ETU campus.                                                                                                                                                      
Unlike the supernatureal horror in the ETU setting, the horror in the Hap and Leonard books is visceral, earthly horror and it is efective because it is man-made, unnerving, mundane yet inhuman.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Hap and Leonard reside in the fictional town of LaBorde, Texas and that can easily be situated close by the fictitious university town of Pinebox. You can easily find a reason for Hap and Leonard to visit Pinebox. They have served as security guards at a chicken processing plant before, so maybe they can do a stint as campus police.                                                                                                     
As far as the timelines are concerned, do not sweat it. Hap and Leonard were very active in the late 80s but the latest novel, Honkytonk Samurai (2016), is set in the 2010s or so (there is a reference to a character making a video using a tablet). Technology seldom plays a big factor in the Hap and Leonard oeuvre and I do not think Joe Lansdale is too fussy when the stories take place on the calendar, as long as the vibe is right.
