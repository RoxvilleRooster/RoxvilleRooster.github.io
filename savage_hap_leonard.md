# Adapting Joe R. Lansdale's Hap and Leonard for the Savage Worlds RPG

_This is a work in progress_

_Updated March 24, 2019_

The point of this page is to describe the characters from the stories for the
Savage Worlds Roleplaying Game.

_There are other good RPGs out there that could facilitate a Hap and Leonard-type game.
The Gumshoe system could handle the investigative aspects quite nicely.
Fate Accelerated (FAE) or Fate Core could be used to considerable effect.
For me, I know Savage Worlds can support a Hap and Leonard-style story, especially when the wisecracks, fists, and bullets begin to fly._

## Stories and the TV series
Hap Collins and Leonard Pine are the main characters in series of novels, novellas, and
short stories by Joe R. Lansdale. Between 2016 and 2018, the Sundance network released three six-episode seasons of [Hap and Leonard](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3729898/?ref_=ttep_ep_tt), which covered the novels "Savage Season", "Mucho Mojo", and "Two Bear Mambo". As you'd expect, the TV series differs from the novels and stories but they are relatively faithful. The TV series is more of a mystery drama with occasional violence, whereas violence, horror, and fisticuffs feature more prominently in the stories.

Looking for more information on Hap and Leonard? See the [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hap_and_Leonard).

## Being a Joe R. Lansdale fan
Joe Lansdale writes some fun, evocative yarns. Thanks to Bruce Campbell and the movie version of Bubba Ho-Tep, I found Champion Joe. I will not claim I have read all of Joe's stuff (the master is prolific) but I have read most of everything related to the Hap and Leonard series. To me, Hap and Leonard are similar to Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser.   

## Being a Savage Worlds gamer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
When I came back to tabletop role-playing games in my early forties, I soon found Savage Worlds. Savage Worlds is my system of choice nowadays because it is versatile and, when played right, fast paced. There is also enough crunch in the rules to satisfy my old-school RPG player wants.                                                                                                                                                

## Savage Worlds and Joe Lansdale's East Texas                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
In 2015, Pinnacle Entertainment Group came out with the East Texas University (ETU) setting, which is a mash up where Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Miskatonic University, and Blue Mountain State meet in Lansdale country. There is even a building named after Champion Joe on the ETU campus.                                                                                                                                                      
Unlike the supernatural horror in the ETU setting, the horror in the Hap and Leonard books is visceral, earthly horror and it is effective because it is man-made, unnerving, mundane yet inhuman.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Hap and Leonard reside in the fictional town of LaBorde, Texas and that can easily be situated close by the fictitious university town of Pinebox. You can easily find a reason for Hap and Leonard to visit Pinebox. They have served as security guards at a chicken processing plant before, so maybe they can do a stint as campus police.                                                                                                     
As far as the time lines are concerned, do not sweat it. Hap and Leonard were very active in the late 80s. The most recent novel, _The Elephant of Surprise_ (March 2019) is likely set in the late 2000s or 2010s, based on the occasional references to devices (e.g., mobile devices). Hap and Leonard don't exactly age as quickly as the rest of us.

## Hap and Leonard as a team
Hap and Leonard are amateur investigators and typically find themselves doing legwork. Where they lack the classic sleuth skills, they get by with a little luck, intuition, and knowledge of the locals and location.

They are unambitious; some see that as lazy. OK, maybe they are a bit lazy but, when these guys get going, they do not sit back.
Hap and Leonard also exemplify a great friendship that crosses lines of race, sexual orientation, and politics. They are very different people but they are brothers and do anything for one another.
