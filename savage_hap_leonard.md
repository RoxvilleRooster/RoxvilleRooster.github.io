# Adapting Joe R. Lansdale's Hap and Leonard for the Savage Worlds RPG

_This is a work in progress_

_Updated February 26, 2018_

Hap Collins and Leonard Pine are the main characters in series of novels, novellas, and
short stories by Joe R. Lansdale. In 2016, the Sundance network released [Hap and Leonard](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3729898/?ref_=ttep_ep_tt), a  six-part TV series that covers the novel "Savage Season". 
In 2017, Sundance TV released season 2 (6 episodes), based on the novel "Mucho Mojo".
In 2018, Sundance TV releases season 3, which is baded on one of my favorite novels, "Two Bear Mambo".
Of course, the TV series differs from the novels and stories. The TV series is more of a mystery drama with occassional violence, whereas I see violence, horrot, and fisticuffs feature more prominenlty in the stories.

The point of this page is to describe the characters from the stories for the
Savage Worlds Roleplaying Game and for other RPGs. 

There are other good RPGs out there that could facilitate a Hap and Leonard-type game.
I bet the Gumshoe system could handle the investigative aspects quite nicely. 
I imagine that Fate Accelerated (FAE) or Fate Core could be used to considerable effect.
To me, I know Savage Worlds can support a Hap and Leonard-style story, especially when the wiescracks, fists, and bullets begin to fly.

Looking for more information on Hap and Leonard? See the [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hap_and_Leonard).

## Being a Joe R. Lansdale fan


Joe Lansdale writes some fun, evocative yarns. Thanks to Bruce Campbell and the movie version of Bubba Ho-Tep, I found Champion Joe. I will not claim I have read all of Joe's stuff (the master is prolific) but I have read most of everything related to the Hap and Leonard series. To me, Hap and Leonard are similar to Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser.   

## Being a Savage Worlds gamer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
When I came back to tabletop role-playing games in my early forties, I soon found Savage Worlds (after an initial foray into Pathfinder). Savage Worlds is my system of choice nowadays because it is versatile and fast. There is also enough crunch in the rules to satisfy my old-schooly wants.                                                                                                                                                

## Savage Worlds and Joe Lansdale's East Texas                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
In 2015, Pinnacle Entertainment Group came out with the East Texas University (ETU) setting, which is a mash up where Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Miskatonic University, and Blue Mountain State meet in Lansdale country. There is even a building named after Champion Joe on the ETU campus.                                                                                                                                                      
Unlike the supernatureal horror in the ETU setting, the horror in the Hap and Leonard books is visceral, earthly horror and it is efective because it is man-made, unnerving, mundane yet inhuman.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Hap and Leonard reside in the fictional town of LaBorde, Texas and that can easily be situated close by the fictitious university town of Pinebox. You can easily find a reason for Hap and Leonard to visit Pinebox. They have served as security guards at a chicken processing plant before, so maybe they can do a stint as campus police.                                                                                                     
As far as the timelines are concerned, do not sweat it. Hap and Leonard were very active in the late 80s but the latest novel, Rusty Puppy (2017), is set in the 2010s.

## Hap and Leonard as a team
Hap and Leonard are amateur investigators andtypically find themselvces doing legwork. Where they lack the classic sleuth skills, they get by with a little luck, intuition, and knowledge of the locals and location.

They are also noty overly ambitious; some see that as lazy. OK, maybe they are a bit lazy but, when these guys get going, they do not sit back. 
Hap and Leonard also exemplify a great friendship that crosses lines of race, sexual orientation, and politics. They are very different people but they are brothers and do anything for one another.
