Being a Lansdale fanboy
----------------------
----------------------
Joe Lansdale writes some fun, evocative yarns. Thanks to Bruce Campbell and the movie version of Bubba Ho-Tep, I found Champion Joe.
I will not claim I have read all of Joe's stuff (the master is prolific) but I have read most of everything related to the Hap and Leonard series.
To me, Hap and Leonard are similar to Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser.

Being a Savage Worlds gamer

When I came back to tabletop role-playing games in my early forties, I soon found Savage Worlds.
