By default, each character has d6 Wealth. Wealth is not a trait but
behaves like one in some respects. Players can spend Bennies, roll the
Wild Die, and benefit from Support rolls.

Typically a setting’s starting funds is $500; some settings start at
$1000. The decision on the setting’s starting funds relates to the
[value penalty table](#table-value-penalty).

## Edges and hindrances

-   The Poverty hindrance decreases the Wealth die by 1 step.

-   The Rich edge increases the Wealth die by 1 step.

    -   The Very Rich edge increases the Wealth die by 1 more step.

-   The Fame edge adds +1 to Wealth rolls.

    -   The Famous edge adds another +1 to Wealth rolls.

## Purchasing items

The cost of the item inflicts a penalty (the *value penalty*) on the
Wealth roll.

NOTE: The GM has the latitude to adjust prices listed in the books for various
reasons just as he can determine [Availability of items](#availability).

## Results of Wealth rolls

| Wealth roll for purchase | Result |
|---|---|
| Critical failure         | Purchase fails but hero can tray again next week or when she gets 1 or more Rewards.  |
| Failure                  | Purchase fails and Wealth is not affected *OR* purchase succeeds as if a Success were rolled but there are strings attached *OR* purchase succeeds and the hero *goes broke*. |
| Success                  | Purchase is successful but the character’s Wealth die is temporarily reduced by 1 die step.  |
| Raise  | Purchase is successful; Wealth die is not reduced.      |

## Purchasing limit

You cannot purchase an item that has a penalty greater than your wealth
die. For example, if the hero has a d8 Wealth, she cannot try to
purchase an item with a penalty of –9 or worse (that is, greater than
$200,000 in value). NOTE: You cannot use Savings, benefit from Support
rolls, and benefit from any other bonuses to Wealth rolls to push a hero
over the purchasing limit.

## Purchasing with strings attached

If the character fails the Wealth roll, the player and GM may jointly
agree that it would be more interesting if the purchase succeeds. The
purchase functions as if a Success were rolled but the character now
owes something else to the seller that has no clear value.

Examples of *strings attached* include:

-   Run an errand

-   Guard something

-   Help me when I call

-   Keep a secret

Of course, this could introduce an economy of favors that might need
tracking. 
<!--There is a setting rule for favors in the *Rippers
Resurrected* setting books.-->

## Going broke

If a hero’s Wealth is reduced below d4, she’s broke. The hero as access
to the basics (simple food, clean enough water, and passable shelter)
unless the GM determines otherwise.

The hero has no resources to purchase transportation, tasty foods,
ammunition, or other typical supplies.

## Support Rolls

You can only Support another character’s Wealth roll by making a Wealth
roll yourself. You assume the same risks as the buyer (for example, on a
Success, you lose a die type in Wealth).

NOTE: The rules are not clear as to whether you can Support another
character’s Wealth roll using an applicable skill.  
For example, the GM can use his discretion and allow a character to roll
the Persuasion skill to Support another character’s Wealth roll to
purchase an item. If the supporting character succeeds, the supporter
also loses a die type in Wealth.

## <a name="availability"></a> Availability of items


For items not available on the open market, you need to use the Research
skill or do some Networking (SWADE 133) to find it. The GM has the say
whether the item is available and the GM can assign modifiers to the
rolls to find the item.

## Rewards

Getting a Reward increases a character’s Wealth die by one step.

Wealth, Rewards, and cost of living are relative. A Reward increase
typically increase lasts only for a month of game. Thrifty heroes can
put their Rewards into Savings.

### Determining Rewards

What qualifies as a Reward? To determine the reward, consider the value
of the payment (and its corresponding *value penalty* from the table)
and the hero’s Wealth die

-   If no wealth roll would be needed to buy the Reward item/amount, it
    is not considered a Reward.

-   If the value of the payment would impose half a value penalty of at
    least half the hero’s Wealth die. For example, in a setting where
    $500 is the starting funds, a $1000 reward imposes -2 value
    penalty.  
    For a hero with 4d Wealth, this Reward is worth 2 Reward points.  
    For a hero with d6 Wealth, this payment is only worth 1 Reward.

-   If the value of the payment would impose a value penalty that is
    greater than the hero’s Wealth die, it is worth at least 3 Reward
    points.

### Savings

A hero can bank her Rewards by exchanging each Reward into 1 point of
Savings. Maximum Savings for a hero is 4. When the hero makes a Wealth
roll, she can choose to apply point from Savings. Each point of Savings
use in the Wealth roll adds +1 to the result. The Savings points used
are removed regardless of whether the Wealth roll succeeds.

The [Expanded Wealth](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/269971/Expanded-Wealth) rules include more optional rules on Lifestyles. I have not factored these rules in yet.
